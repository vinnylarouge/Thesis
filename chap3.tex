\chapter{Text circuits for syntax}\label{chapter:textcircuits}
We want to establish that there is a systematic correspondence between text circuits and grammatically acceptable text, which would allow us to use text circuits as a generative grammar without further justification. First we show that context-free grammars, string-rewrite systems, and tree-adjoining grammars are all special cases of higher-dimensional rewriting systems called weak $n$-categories. Then we provide a "circuit-growing" grammar in terms of a weak $n$-categorical signature that simultaneously generates strings of grammatically acceptable text and its "deep structure" in terms of text circuits, from which we obtain the desired correspondence between text circuits and text. We close with demonstrations of how the syntactic theory of text circuits may be modified and expanded, and a brief note on how text circuits relate to Montague's "Universal Grammar".
