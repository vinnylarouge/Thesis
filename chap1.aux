Apart from a stock of basic types $\PazoBB  {B}$ that contains special final types to indicate sentences, we have two type formation operators $(-/=)$ and $(- \setminus =)$, which along with their elimination rules establish a requirement that grammatical categories require other grammatical categories to their left or right.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {19}{\ignorespaces To eliminate this asymmetry, Lambek devised pregroup grammars. Whereas a group is a monoid with inverses up to left- and right-multiplication, a pregroup weakens the requirement for inverses so that all elements have distinct left- and right- inverses, denoted $x^{-1}$ and $^{-1}x$ respectively. Eliminating or introducing inverses is a non-identity relation on elements of the pregroup, so we have axioms of the form e.g. $x \cdot ^{-1}x \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow ^{1}x \cdot x$. In this formulation, denoting the multiplication with a dot, both $(n/s)\setminus n$ and $(n/s)\setminus n$ become $^{-1}n \cdot s \cdot n^{-1}$, which just wants a noun to the left and a noun to the right in whatever order to eliminate the flanking inverses to reveal the embedded sentence type. Now we can obtain the same proof of correctness as a series of algebraic reductions. \par \begin  {align*} & &n \cdot (^{-1}n \cdot s \cdot n^{-1}) \cdot n\\ &\rightarrow &(n \cdot ^{-1}n) \cdot s \cdot (n^{-1} \cdot n)\\ &\rightarrow & 1 \cdot s \cdot 1\\ &\rightarrow & s \end  {align*} }}{33}{subsection.0.7.1}\protected@file@percent }

The basic types $n$ and $s$ are assigned finite-dimensional vector spaces, concatenation of types the kronecker product $\otimes $, and by the isomorphism of dual spaces in finite dimensions there is no need to keep track of the left- and right- inverse data. Words become vectors, and pregroup reductions become bell-states, or bell-measurements, depending on whether one reads top-down or bottom-up.

Briefly, G\"{a}rdenfors posits \citep  {gardenfors_geometry_2014} that spatial representations of concepts mediate raw sense data and symbolic representations -- e.g. red is a region in colourspace -- and moreover that concepts ought to be spatially convex -- e.g. mixing any two shades of red still gives red. A new point in the value proposition arose: that new mathematics would arise from investigating the linguistic-quantum bridge, e.g. generalised relations \citep  {marsden_custom_2017}. Although labelled as if it is the first in a series, the paper never saw a sequel by the same title, blocked by an apparently simple but actually tricky theoretical problem: while this convex-relational story worked for conceptual adjectives modifying a single noun (such as for "sweet yellow bananas"), there was difficulty in extending the story to work for multiple objects interacting in the same space, as in "cup on table in room". It couldn't be worked out what structure a sentence-wire in \textbf  {ConvexRel} ought to have in order to accommodate (in principle) arbitrarily many objects and spatial relations between them.\\ \par DisCoCat then diverges from the story I want to tell.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {31}{\ignorespaces It is a common evolutionary step in linguistics that theories "break the sentential barrier", moving from sentence-restricted to text- or discourse-level analysis. The same thing happened with DisCoCirc, due to a combination of practical constraints and theoretical ambition. On the practical side, wide tensors were (and remain) prohibitively expensive to simulate classically and actual quantum computers did not (and still do not) have many qubits, hence in practice pregroup diagrams were reduced to thinner and deeper circuits, often with the help of an additional simplifying assumption that sentence wires were pairs of noun wires in the illustrated form on the left. Theoretically, seeking dynamic epistemic logic, Bob had an epiphanous hangover (really) where he envisioned that these "Cartesian verbs" could be used in service of compositional text meanings, and he called this idea DisCoCirc \citep  {coecke_mathematics_2020}.}}{41}{subsection.0.7.5}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {33}{\ignorespaces Then COVID happened. During the first lockdown, I visited Bob's garden under technically legal circumstances, and I suggested a solution to the longstanding problem of representing linguistic spatial relationships. My theoretical concern was the culprit: the initial attempts at the problem failed because the approach was to find a single sentence object $s$ in which one could paste the data of arbitrarily many distinct spatial entities. The simple solution was a change in perspective.}}{43}{subsection.0.7.5}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {34}{\ignorespaces That this move of splitting up the sentence-wire into a sentence-dependent collection of wires was sufficient to solve what had appeared to be a difficult problem prompted some re-examination of foundations. The free autonomisation trick in conjunction with sentence-wire-as-tensored-nouns seemed promising, but it became clear that right way to drown a DisCoCat thoroughly was to explain and eliminate the spiders.}}{43}{subsection.0.7.5}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {35}{\ignorespaces I then discovered that by interpreting spiders as the well-known "pair of pants" algebra in a compact closed monoidal setting allowed for a procedure in which the final form was purely symmetric monoidal -- the absence of cups and caps meant that there was no practical necessity to interpret diagrams on quantum computers: \emph  {any} computer would suffice. The role of spiders for relative pronouns was illuminated in the presence of splitting the sentence wire: the pair-of-pants are the algebra of morphism composition, and splitting the sentence wire into a collection of nouns allowed relative-pronoun-spiders to pick out the participating nouns to compose relationships onto.}}{44}{subsection.0.7.5}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {36}{\ignorespaces A coherent conservative generalisation of DisCoCat with less baggage had emerged, or rather, DisCoCirc was placed to formally subsume DisCoCat. It was now understood that the sentence type was a formal syntactic ansatz for the sake of grammar, which was to be interpreted in the semantic domain not as a single wire, but as a sentence-dependent collection of wires. It was further realised that the complexity of pregroup diagrams was due to grammar -- the topological deformation of semantic connections to fit the one-dimensional line of language -- whereas the essential connective content of language could be expressed in a simple form that distilled away the bureaucracy of syntax.}}{45}{subsection.0.7.5}\protected@file@percent }

At this point in time, Jonathon Liu, a masters' student I tutored during COVID, had committed the grave error of thinking diagrams were cool, and was now hanging out with me and Bob. After understanding the procedure, Jono independently devised the same arcane internal wirings as I had, but neither of us could explain how we did it.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {41}{\ignorespaces I realised that our intuitions were coming from an implicit productive grammar, rather than a parsing one, and that the path of least resistance for obtaining formal guarantees for the language-to-circuit procedure was to just handcraft a generative grammar for the fragment of language we were interested in. This meant scrapping everything in the first draft and starting again from scratch. Bob always had a word of gentle encouragement, giving me the motivation to persevere.\\ \par So now we had two ways to obtain text circuits. One from pregroups (which Jono had extended the technique for to CCGs and dependency grammars in his master's thesis \citep  {liu_language_2021}), and one from handcrafted productive grammars. Then came time for me to write my thesis, and there were three salient questions I wanted to address.\\ First, what are internal wirings?\\ Second, how do text circuits relate to other generative grammars?\\ Third, what are text circuits good for?\\ These questions are now what the rest of the thesis seeks to answer. }}{50}{subsection.0.7.5}\protected@file@percent }
