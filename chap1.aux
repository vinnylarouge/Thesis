The type formation rules for such a grammar are intuitive. Apart from a stock of basic types $\PazoBB  {B}$ that contains special final types to indicate sentences, we have two type formation operators $(-/=)$ and $(- \setminus =)$, which along with their elimination rules establish a requirement that grammatical categories require other grammatical categories to their left or right. This is the essence of Lambek's calculi \textbf  {NL} and \textbf  {L}.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.3}{\ignorespaces To eliminate this asymmetry, Lambek devised pregroup grammars. Whereas a group is a monoid with inverses up to left- and right-multiplication, a pregroup weakens the requirement for inverses so that all elements have distinct left- and right- inverses, denoted $x^{-1}$ and $^{-1}x$ respectively. Eliminating or introducing inverses is a non-identity relation on elements of the pregroup, so we have axioms of the form e.g. $x \cdot ^{-1}x \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow ^{1}x \cdot x$. In this formulation, denoting the multiplication with a dot, both $(n/s)\setminus n$ and $(n/s)\setminus n$ become $^{-1}n \cdot s \cdot n^{-1}$, which just wants a noun to the left and a noun to the right in whatever order to eliminate the flanking inverses to reveal the embedded sentence type. Now we can obtain the same proof of correctness as a series of algebraic reductions. \par \begin  {align} & &n \cdot (^{-1}n \cdot s \cdot n^{-1}) \cdot n\\ &\rightarrow &(n \cdot ^{-1}n) \cdot s \cdot (n^{-1} \cdot n)\\ &\rightarrow & 1 \cdot s \cdot 1\\ &\rightarrow & s \end  {align} }}{24}{subsection.1.1.1}\protected@file@percent }

Steve asked Bob, who realised suddenly what Jim was talking about. Mediated by the linguistic expertise of Mehrnoosh who was a postdoctoral researcher in Oxford at the time, pregroup diagrams were born. The basic types $n$ and $s$ are assigned finite-dimensional vector spaces, concatenation of types the hadamard product $\otimes $, and by the isomorphism of dual spaces in finite dimensions there is no need to keep track of the left- and right- inverse data. Words become vectors, and pregroup reductions become bell-states, or bell-measurements, depending on whether one reads top-down or bottom-up.

If one follows the noun-wire of "movies", one sees that by declaring the relative pronoun to be a vector made up of a particular bunch of spiders-as-multiwires, "movies" is copied to be related to the "liked" word, copied again by "which" to be related to the "is-famous" word, and a third time to act as the noun in the whole noun-phrase. This discovery clarified a value proposition: insights from quantum theory could be applied in the linguistic setting, and linguistics offered a novel use-case for quantum computers. For example, density matrices were used to model semantic ambiguity \begin  {color}{red}CITE \end  {color}\xspace  , and natural language experiments were performed on real quantum computeres \begin  {color}{red}CITE \end  {color}\xspace  .}}{32}{subsection.1.1.4}\protected@file@percent }

Briefly, G\"{a}rdenfors posits that spatial representations of concepts mediate raw sense data and symbolic representations -- e.g. red is a region in colourspace -- and moreover that concepts ought to be spatially convex -- e.g. mixing any two shades of red still gives red. This paper created a new point in the value proposition: that new mathematics would arise from investigating the linguistic-quantum bridge, e.g. generalised relations \begin  {color}{red}CITE \end  {color}\xspace  . Although labelled as if it is the first in a series, the paper never saw a sequel by the same title, blocked by an apparently simple but actually tricky theoretical problem. The problem is that while this convex-relational story worked for conceptual adjectives modifying a single noun such for "sweet yellow bananas", there was difficulty in extending the story to work for multiple objects interacting in the same space, as in "cup on table in room". It couldn't be worked out what structure a sentence-wire in \textbf  {ConvexRel} ought to have in order to accommodate (in principle) arbitrarily many objects and spatial relations between them.\\ \par DisCoCat then diverges from the story I want to tell.

On the practical side, wide tensors were (and remain) prohibitively expensive to simulate classically and actual quantum computers did not (and still do not) have many qubits, hence in practice pregroup diagrams were reduced to thinner and deeper circuits, often with the help of an additional simplifying assumption that sentence wires were pairs of noun wires in the illustrated form on the left.
