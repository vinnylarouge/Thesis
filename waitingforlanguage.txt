ACT I

The stage is bare except for a single tree in the center. The tree has buttress roots that arch off of the ground, giving the impression that each branch veins smoothly into the ground. The sky is gray and featureless. Two figures, CHOMSKY and HINTON, are standing next to the tree. They are dressed in shabby clothes, and their faces are worn and tired. They do not move or speak for several moments, but simply stand there staring off into the distance.

CHOMSKY: (after a long pause) Do you ever wonder why we're here?

HINTON: (gruffly) What does it matter? We're here and we're talking, aren't we?

A long silence.

CHOMSKY: (thoughtfully) Yes, we're really talking, aren't we? Let's see one of your machines \emph{really} talk.

HINTON: (exasperated) Of course they do. A machine helped to write my lines. Let's see one of \emph{your} machines do that. Oh, that's right, you don't have one.

They lapse into silence once more, staring out into the void. The tree casts a long shadow across the stage, as if to remind them of the fleeting nature of time. The sun begins to set, casting an orange glow over the scene.

CHOMSKY: (rapidly) But you see, there's a fundamental problem with your approach. By relying solely on machine learning algorithms to analyze language, you're missing the underlying structure that gives rise to it. It's like trying to understand the behavior of atoms without knowing anything about the laws of physics.

HINTON: (diplomatically) I understand your point, Noam, but you're oversimplifying the capabilities of these algorithms. Deep learning models can now identify patterns in language that were previously thought to be impossible to discern.

CHOMSKY: (passionately) Yes, but patterns alone don't tell the whole story. Language isn't just a collection of statistically significant patterns. It's a complex system that follows rules, and those rules have to be understood if we're ever going to create machines that can truly understand language.

HINTON: (beseechingly) But isn't it possible that the rules emerge from the patterns? That we don't need to explicitly define them?

CHOMSKY: (humourously) I don't think so. That would be like saying that the rules of chess emerge from the moves that players make. Yes, the moves are important, but they only make sense in the context of the rules of the game.

A terrible cry, close at hand. Huddled together, shoulders haunched, cringing away from the menace, Chomsky and Hinton wait. Enter Wittgenstein (late) and Wittgenstein (early). The elder drives the younger around by means of a rope passed around his neck, so that the younger is first to enter. The younger is burdened by an intimidating pile of scrap paper, covered with mathematics, the elder a whip.

ELDER-WITTGENSTEIN: Ho! (The elder periodically cracks his whip, causing the younger to wince in excited activity without a change in expression.) Gentlemen! I present myself and so on. Now about language as a game, Noam, the rules of chess \emph{do} emerge from the moves the players make. In the course of play, they are affirmed (whip.) negotiated (whip.) and change (whip.) with context!

HINTON: (timidly at first, then bravely) Yes! Machine Learning can detect and reflect these games in the data! That's something we can never hope to capture with rules fixed from the start!

CHOMSKY: (timidly at first, then dismissively) Statistical learning. You've taken the complexity and richness of human language and reduced it to probabilities and correlations. If we want to \emph{understand} these games, we need to first understand how the basics of language work, how we generate and understand sentences. You're speaking of the surface-level of language, and I'm talking about the deep-structure.

Enter Lakoff, seamlessly.

LAKOFF: (laughing) Surface? Deep? That's a metaphor if I've ever seen one, Noam, and let's not rehash what happens to the idea of a universal grammar when it's clear that our understanding of everything is mediated through metaphors that vary throughout cultures. That includes language! There's no deep structure to point at, Noam, it could be metaphors all the way down.

HINTON: (confidently) You know, gentlemen, that the latest language models can understand metaphor too? So much for Turing, and so much for your symbolic business, eh?

Enter Lambek and Coecke, to general bewilderment.

LAMBEK: (jovially and seriously) Actually, Noam, \emph{understanding} language requires something other than a generative model. My typelogical grammars provide the mathematics of parsing language. Say, Geoffrey, my typelogical grammars are doing well at parsing when combined with machine learning, isn't that something?

COECKE: (slightly drunk) Hey let me say! I'm the one doing that stuff now, and on \emph{quantum compuders}! It's all diagrams too, you know. It's a pictorial maths to put together machine learning using the structure of language, like legos!

LAMBEK: (matter-of-factly) Category Theory. The bridge between your rules-based systems and your data-driven learning.

A sudden and deep silence. Nobody else has heard of category theory. The silence is punctuated by cracks of the whip and throat-clearing. In time they all turn to ponder the tree with buttress roots. The moon rises, casting a cool blue light over the stage.

COECKE: (sighing) That's why I never say "Category Theory" Jim.

WITTGENSTEINS: (quietly, in unison) We see.

LAKOFF: (softly) A metalanguage for composition and interaction. But tell me, how do you explain metaphors in this mathematics?

WITTGENSTEINS: (quickly) And what of truth-theoretic semantics? What of interactions between speakers?

HINTON: (skeptically) I've seen something like these diagrams before, in neural network architectures. But from what I understand, quantum computers are still a long way off. Can't we just do all this you suggest on normal computers?

CHOMSKY: (undecidedly) This seems right for infinite use of finite means, but there's still a gap between your vector semantics and true grounding of meaning.

A voice from offstage interrupts Chomsky.

GARDENF\"{O}RS: You can use geometry as a middleman between symbolic meaning and vector spaces!

CHOMSKY: (sharply) And, even if a machine could ground and understand those meanings, a typelogical grammar to parse language presupposes a deep-structure for language generated by the speaker; to borrow a turn of thought from Ludwig, you are only pointing at an underlying generative structure without describing it.

Another silence, all are deep in thought.


COECKE: (frustratedly) What the hell are you doing here anyway? You know this is academic suicide, right? Get down from there and fuck off!

ME: (drawing on the tree with chalk) Relax, Bob. You said it yourself, nobody reads theses anyway, so let me have some fun. Can you see this Noam? Jim? I know there isn't enough light. I wish I could show you more clearly.

All gather to look at the chalk wires on the tree. Coecke mutters curses under his breath. I climb down, gesturing at the branches, the tips of which are decorated with tangles of wires. The wires snake down to the roots.

ME: Ludwig, you're right that the rules of the game and the moves of the players shape and constrain each other. You can see the listener's parse in the diagram, and the tree itself is the generative structure from the trunk to the branch tips. The decorated tree as a whole is a prescription for a special kind of functor from generative to typelogical grammars that lets the two interact on equal footing, and this captures the interaction of speaker and listener mathematically.

I point at the roots of the tree. All eyes follow the wires from the branches down to their respective roots.

ME: The sentence type is a convenience for syntax. In the semantics, we need as many wires as is appropriate to carry all the meaning of the sentence. Geoff, the result is a circuit component, which we can compose on normal computers. Instead of learning all of meaning and language structure from data at once in a big black box, we can learn smaller black boxes, composed as the structure of language dictates. And if everything goes right, we'll know exactly what's going on in the mind of the machine.

I gesture wildly at everything, to general confusion from everyone.

ME: But how did I paint a picture about language in your minds using marks on this tree? My pictures aren't a true or false reflection of language as it exists in the world! Sound familiar, George? All I did was sketch a metaphor for the shape of language. You all saw earlier how in the right mathematical setting for topological doodles, category theory can be used to not only capture spatial groundings of meaning, but also to capture metaphor as structural correspondences between text circuits! Look at what I can do with anaphora, with semantically prime verbs of cognition, with stories!

COECKE: Calm down! Stop yelling!

A silence. It all seems a bit half-baked to everyone.

ME: I'm sorry, I've never been good at expressing my thoughts clearly and simply, and I get frustrated at myself. I find it hard to linearise the thoughts in my head, which are all joined-together and messy. You all have big serious ideas, and all I seem to have are small piles of little ones. It fits together in my head until I open my mouth. I'm a silly person with silly ideas, as you can tell from what's happening right now. But until I grow into someone different, this is who I am now.

A short pause.

ME: But I've always enjoyed making people laugh, even if it's at my expense. I suppose I'm serious about having fun together, because that's the only thing that makes sense to me to take seriously. Sometimes I also get possessed by seriousness when I'm playing with diagrams, you must know that itching want to see where the play leads.

I break into laughter out of embarrassment. I know that a self-insert fanfiction seems like a cute idea now, but I have a feeling some future me is going to cringe at the memory. The others vanish, because it was only me and the marked tree all along. I'm only talking to myself now.

ME: My ideas are basic, others have gone deeper in understanding language. I'm not even sure that by combining ideas from others I can truly call them my own. Maybe I'll just say that I'm not a linguist or even a particularly good computer scientist or mathematician. I'm some kind of formal-diagram-artist, that's it. Wait, I shouldn't end it on a self-deprecating note, I should be brave, and maybe playful if they're bored already...?

COECKE: (from my head) Just shut up! Finish!

ME: Hold on, I got it. Language is at least as complicated as anything else we can possibly collectively understand, and at least as complicated as any theory of language. We each have our own mental sea and we can't empty this vast ocean by pouring ourselves in, we can only ever paddle at the shallows. What's wrong with just playing together in the water? We don't have to despair at the possibility that it will never all fit inside one person's head, we can just play the game and tell each other stories, precisely because none of it really matters! Let's not blind ourselves with seriousness and self-importance, let's just jam out together and see what sounds good. String diagrams are just my way to play, and play alone has to be enough.
