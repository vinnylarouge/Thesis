\section{A Partial History of String Diagrams}

\emph{Algebra is the offer made by the devil to the mathematician. The devil says: "I will give you this powerful machine, it will answer any question you like. All you need to do is give me your soul: give up geometry and you will have this marvellous machine."} - Michael Atiyah

String diagrams are a loophole in the devil's contract. Descartes cast geometry as algebra, and string diagrams do the reverse.

\newthought{We have always tried to capture language in diagrams.}\\
Every so often, someone tries once again to draw the shape of language.\\
...\\
Now it's our turn.\\
The difference this time is formality; we are using \emph{string diagrams}.

\newthought{String diagrams are formal reasoning and representation systems for monoidal categories.} Chronologically, those adjectives occurred in this order: 1) visual representation, 2) visual reasoning, 3) formal.

\subsection{Pre-formal Diagrams}

Pre-formal diagrams are about visual expression. By the restrictions of writing technologies, the kind of visual representations we are interested in are two-dimensional. So visual means geometric in the plane. The ancient ancestors of modern string diagrams are systems for visual representation alone. For these ancestral diagrams, reasoning, if there is any, takes place `elsewhere', not within and between diagrams.\\

\subsection{Convergent Evolution}

String diagrams arise naturally as diagrammatic representations for formal theories where reoccurring variables or bookkeeping indices for keep track of pairwise connections become too unwieldy for one-dimensional syntax.
