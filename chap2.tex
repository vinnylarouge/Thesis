\chapter{Internal wirings: what, why, and where from?}
\textbf{Chapter summary:} Speakers \emph{produce}, and listeners \emph{parse} sentences. If we believe that semantics is compositional according to syntax, because communication is possible, these two ways of conceiving of grammar (e.g. string-rewrite systems and typelogical grammars, respectively) must be mathematically related: the semantics of a sentence ought to be "the same" in either grammar. Using string diagrams as semantics allows us to formalise "sameness" as "up to topological deformation", and internal wirings constitute a shared representation strategy on words between speaker and listener that witnesses this topological equivalence for any sentence that both grammars can produce. However, internal wirings are not functorially determined by syntax: the same word may have different internal wirings in a way that depends systematically on context. We can capture this systematicity as a span of functors, for which we develop a diagrammatic technique that works like functor boxes, along with the attendant mathematics.
