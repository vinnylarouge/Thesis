They got to the theater and found that the only movie playing was a boring documentary. So, they decided to sneak into the theater next door, which was showing a horror movie. They were enjoying the movie, when all of a sudden, the power went out.

The theater was plunged into darkness, and Charlie and Dennis were terrified. They tried to find their way out, but they couldn't see anything. They ended up getting lost and ended up in the basement of the theater. They were so scared that they hugged each other for comfort.

Eventually, they found their way out and they swore never to skip class again. They learned their lesson and they were better friends for it.
