\textbf{Acknowledgements}
To my parents and siblings: thank you for supporting me. I don't know how I can ever make it all up to you, but I'll try my best. I love you.\\

To my academic parents, Bob and Philipp. Thank you for your tutelage. I am glad to have found brothers in life such as you, and I hope we can tell many more stories together.\\

To my seniors --- Dan and Konstantinos here at Oxford; Jamie in Cambridge, Dusko through our letters; Salvadore, Beau and Sean throughout our time at LPPRD; Luciano and Rosaria at those wonderful meetings at the OII; Martha and Mehrnoosh and Moortgat at ESSLI; David and David and Brendan at Topos in sunny California; Pawel and Amar in (less sunny) Estonia; and Tim from across the desk-castle. You walked far along the paths I am still only just setting out on. Thank you for sharing your lessons with me.\\

A special thanks for you, Jules and Stefano. You actually read the whole damn thing and sat with me through six and a half hours of viva. It was an honour to get doctored by you.\\

To my cohort, both in Oxford --- Nick, Nicola Lukas, Guillaume, Cole, Sivert, Nihil, James, Matt --- and elsewhere --- Mario, Elena, Chad, Nathan, Bruno, Matteo, Eigil --- COVID made for an unusual DPhil, but I wouldn't have had it any other way because of you. Thank you for teaching me so much.\\

To Jono, Ben, Razin, Lia, Hamza, and Tiffany. I'm sorry for whatever part I played in getting you into this language business, it seemed like a good idea at the time. I hope at least it's a springboard towards better things. For Jono in particular: thanks for qualming.\\

To Aleks, Ilyas, and the little demon who helps me convert various drugs into diagrams and text at the cost of my health: thank you for the environments you have looked after, within which this thesis was made logistically possible.\\

To my future council of godfathers for my son Felix: Andrew, Colin, Maxim, Will, and Joel. Thank you for putting up with me and keeping me grounded.\\

Paulina, my love. Thank you for sticking with me and helping me grow. Nothing is as important to me as being happy together with you.

\textbf{Novel contributions:}
\begin{itemize}

\item Section \ref{sec:weakn} is a pedestrian introduction to weak $n$-category theory (via \texttt{homotopy.io}, underpinned by the theory of associative $n$-categories) from the perspective of generalising familiar string-rewrite systems to higher dimensions. The chief development of this section is a demonstration that context-free grammars and tree-adjoining grammars may be formalised in the $n$-categorical setting.

\item Section \ref{sec:gencirc} spells out a generative grammar for text using an $n$-categorical signature as a rewrite system, which additionally provides a unified framework from which the Text Circuit Theorem first proved in \citep{wang-mascianica_distilling_2023} is recovered.

\item Section \ref{sec:contrelintro} introduces the category \textbf{ContRel} of continuous relations. I detail the relationships (or lack thereof) of \textbf{ContRel} to its cousins \textbf{Top} and \textbf{Rel} in Section \ref{sec:contrelmath}. Though \textbf{ContRel} is constructed na\"{i}vely, its definition and an exposition of its expressivity from the monoidal perspective appears to be novel.

\item Section \ref{sec:stickyspider} string-diagrammatically characterises set-indexed collections of disjoint open subsets of spaces in \textbf{ContRel} as \emph{sticky spiders} -- special frobenius algebras that satisfy certain interaction relations with an idempotent. The diagrammatic outcome is that reasoning with such set-indexed collections remains as graphically intuitive as with spiders.

\item Section \ref{sec:concepts} string-diagrammatically characterises a vocabulary of linguistic topological relations in \textbf{ContRel} such as simple connectedness, touching, insideness, and rigid motion.

\item Section \ref{sec:miracle} argues for the centrality of explaining communication as a criterion for formal approaches to syntax, and explores the relationship between productive and parsing grammars as organised by a monoidal cofunctor. A diagrammatic treatment of monoidal cofunctor boxes is introduced for this purpose.

\item Section \ref{sec:monty} is a standalone introduction to the mathematical setup of Montague's \emph{Universal Grammar}, aimed at modern algebraists. An outcome of this section is the placement of text circuits as a natural mathematical development in the broadly conceived programme of Montague Semantics.

\item Subsection \ref{subsec:toptext} constructs a subcategory of sticky spiders in \textbf{ContRel} on the unit square that behaves as a model of \textbf{FinRel} equipped with a Turing object, and argues for its relevance in formal semantics.

\item In Section \ref{sec:metaphor}, by parsing text as circuits (Section \ref{sec:gencirc}) and using merge-boxes (Section \ref{sec:miracle}) to interpret those circuits in \textbf{ContRel} as iconic representations equipped with a vocabulary of lingustic-topological concepts (Section \ref{sec:concepts}), I show how one may compute metaphors by hand.

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Context and synopsis}
There are potentially practical and theoretical benefits to a fresh mathematical take on basic linguistics. String diagrams are formal, intuitive, expressive, fun, and pretty. I review the relevant research context.

\chapter{On communication}\label{chapter:internalwirings}
Speakers produce, and listeners parse sentences. If we believe that semantics is compositional according to syntax, because communication is possible, these two ways of conceiving of grammar (e.g. string-rewrite systems and typelogical grammars, respectively) must be mathematically related: the semantics of a sentence ought to be "the same" in either grammar. Using string diagrams as semantics allows us to formalise "sameness" as "up to topological deformation", where \emph{internal wirings} constitute a shared representation strategy on words between speaker and listener that witnesses this topological equivalence for any sentence that both grammars can produce. However, internal wirings are not functorially determined by syntax: the same word may have different internal wirings in a way that depends systematically on context. We can capture this systematicity as a span of functors closely related to cofunctors, for which we develop a string-diagrammatic reasoning technique that works like functor boxes, along with the attendant mathematics.

\chapter{Text circuits for syntax}\label{chapter:textcircuits}
We establish a systematic correspondence between text circuits and grammatically acceptable text, which allows us to use text circuits as a generative grammar without further justification. First we show that context-free grammars, string-rewrite systems, and tree-adjoining grammars are all special cases of higher-dimensional rewriting systems called weak $n$-categories. Then we provide a "circuit-growing" grammar in terms of a weak $n$-categorical signature that simultaneously generates strings of grammatically acceptable text and its "deep structure" in terms of text circuits, from which we obtain the desired correspondence between text circuits and text.

\chapter{Continuous relations for semantics}\label{chapter:contrel}
We want a setting within which to reason formally with and about pictorial iconic representations, of the sort one might draw to illustrate a conceptual schema from cognitive linguistics. For this I introduce and investigate the category of continuous relations, \textbf{ContRel}.
