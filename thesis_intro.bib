Our diagrams present architectures intuitively but without loss of essential detail, where natural relationships between models are captured by graphical transformations, and important differences and similarities can be identified at a glance. In this paper, we focus on attention mechanisms: translating folklore into mathematical derivations, and constructing a taxonomy of attention variants in the literature. As a first example of an empirical investigation underpinned by our formalism, we identify recurring anatomical components of attention, which we exhaustively recombine to explore a space of variations on the attention mechanism.},

  abstract = {Idealised as universal approximators, learners such as neural networks can be viewed as "variable functions" that may become one of a range of concrete functions after training. In the same way that equations constrain the possible values of variables in algebra, we may view objective functions as constraints on the behaviour of learners. We extract the equivalences perfectly optimised objective functions impose, calling them "tasks". For these tasks, we develop a formal graphical language that allows us to: (1) separate the core tasks of a behaviour from its implementation details; (2) reason about and design behaviours model-agnostically; and (3) simply describe and unify approaches in machine learning across domains. As proof-of-concept, we design a novel task that enables converting classifiers into generative models we call "manipulators", which we implement by directly translating task specifications into code. The resulting models exhibit capabilities such as style transfer and interpretable latent-space editing, without the need for custom architectures, adversarial training or random sampling. We formally relate the behaviour of manipulators to GANs, and empirically demonstrate their competitive performance with VAEs. We report on experiments across vision and language domains aiming to characterise manipulators as approximate Bayesian inversions of discriminative classifiers.},

  abstract = {Functional analyses of grammatical phenomena, and the functionalist approaches that promote them, are appealing to those who believe that an integrated view of language structure and language function is desirable. But functional analyses have been held to founder on basic grammatical facts that are taken to support the autonomy of grammar. The concept of autonomy is a complex one, and at least two different notions are found in current linguistic theory: arbitrariness and self-containedness. These notions of autonomy apply either to the syntactic component of the grammar, or (a more recent claim) to the grammar itself, with respect to change, use, and acquisition. The arbitrariness of syntax must be accepted; and many functional analyses are compatible with selfcontainedness. However, mixed formal/functional analyses provide an argument against the self-containedness of syntax, and in fact even many formal theories of syntax accept non-self-containedness. The arbitrariness of grammatical knowledge must also be accepted; and many functional analyses of the dynamic process affecting grammar are compatible with self-containedness. An argument against the self-containedness of grammar comes not from these functional analyses but from sociolinguistics.}

  abstract = {In this response to Pinker and Jackendoff's critique, we extend our previous framework for discussion of language evolution, clarifying certain distinctions and elaborating on a number of points. In the first half of the paper, we reiterate that profitable research into the biology and evolution of language requires fractionation of "language" into component mechanisms and interfaces, a non-trivial endeavor whose results are unlikely to map onto traditional disciplinary boundaries. Our terminological distinction between FLN and FLB is intended to help clarify misunderstandings and aid interdisciplinary rapprochement. By blurring this distinction, Pinker and Jackendoff mischaracterize our hypothesis 3 which concerns only FLN, not "language" as a whole. Many of their arguments and examples are thus irrelevant to this hypothesis. Their critique of the minimalist program is for the most part equally irrelevant, because very few of the arguments in our original paper were tied to this program; in an online appendix we detail the deep inaccuracies in their characterization of this program. Concerning evolution, we believe that Pinker and Jackendoff's emphasis on the past adaptive history of the language faculty is misplaced. Such questions are unlikely to be resolved empirically due to a lack of relevant data, and invite speculation rather than research. Preoccupation with the issue has retarded progress in the field by diverting research away from empirical questions, many of which can be addressed with comparative data. Moreover, offering an adaptive hypothesis as an alternative to our hypothesis concerning mechanisms is a logical error, as questions of function are independent of those concerning mechanism. The second half of our paper consists of a detailed response to the specific data discussed by Pinker and Jackendoff. Although many of their examples are irrelevant to our original paper and arguments, we find several areas of substantive disagreement that could be resolved by future empirical research. We conclude that progress in understanding the evolution of language will require much more empirical research, grounded in modern comparative biology, more interdisciplinary collaboration, and much less of the adaptive storytelling and phylogenetic speculation that has traditionally characterized the field.},

Chomsky shared the field's general skepticism about the possibility of semantics as a subject of scientific study, but as semantics began to be developed in the context of generative grammar, the issue of the connection between syntax and semantics came to the fore very quickly and soon became a major area of research. {\quotesinglbase}Formal semantics‛ arose a little later, with the logician Richard Montague as the key figure in its origins, and linguists, logicians, and philosophers cooperated in its early development.

In this paper we solve these problems by reformulating DisCoCat as a passage from Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) to a category of semantics. We start by showing that standard categorial grammars can be expressed as a biclosed category, where all rules emerge as currying/uncurrying the identity; we then proceed to model permutation-inducing rules by exploiting the symmetry of the compact closed category encoding the word meaning. We provide a proof of concept for our method, converting "Alice in Wonderland" into DisCoCat form, a corpus that we make available to the community.},

  abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to present an extension to the string graphs of Dixon, Duncan and Kissinger that allows the finite representation of certain infinite families of graphs and graph rewrite rules, and to demonstrate that a logic can be built on this to allow the formalisation of inductive proofs in the string diagrams of compact closed and traced symmetric monoidal categories. String diagrams provide an intuitive method for reasoning about monoidal categories. However, this does not negate the ability for those using them to make mistakes in proofs. To this end, there is a project (Quantomatic) to build a proof assistant for string diagrams, at least for those based on categories with a notion of trace. The development of string graphs has provided a combinatorial formalisation of string diagrams, laying the foundations for this project. The prevalence of commutative Frobenius algebras (CFAs) in quantum information theory, a major application area of these diagrams, has led to the use of variable-arity nodes as a shorthand for normalised networks of Frobenius algebra morphisms, so-called "spider notation". This notation greatly eases reasoning with CFAs, but string graphs are inadequate to properly encode this reasoning. This dissertation extends string graphs to allow for variable-arity nodes to be represented at all, and then introduces !-box notation (and structures to encode it) to represent string graph equations containing repeated subgraphs, where the number of repetitions is abitrary. It then demonstrates how we can reason directly about !-graphs, viewed as (typically infinite) families of string graphs. Of particular note is the presentation of a form of graph-based induction, allowing the formal encoding of proofs that previously could only be represented as a mix of string diagrams and explanatory text.},

  abstract = {String diagrams provide a convenient graphical framework which may be used for equational reasoning about morphisms of monoidal categories. However, unlike term rewriting, rewriting string diagrams results in shorter equational proofs, because the string diagrammatic representation allows us to formally establish equalities modulo any rewrite steps which follow from the monoidal structure. Manipulating string diagrams by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially for large string diagrams. This can be ameliorated by using software proof assistants, such as Quantomatic. However, reasoning about concrete string diagrams may be limiting and in some scenarios it is necessary to reason about entire (infinite) families of string diagrams. When doing so, we face the same problems as for manipulating concrete string diagrams, but in addition, we risk making further mistakes if we are not precise enough about the way we represent (infinite) families of string diagrams. The primary goal of this thesis is to design a mathematical framework for equational reasoning about infinite families of string diagrams which is amenable to computer automation. We will be working with context-free families of string diagrams and we will represent them using context-free graph grammars. We will model equations between infinite families of diagrams using rewrite rules between context-free grammars. Our framework represents equational reasoning about concrete string diagrams and context-free families of string diagrams using double-pushout rewriting on graphs and context-free graph grammars respectively. We will prove that our representation is sound by showing that it respects the concrete semantics of string diagrammatic reasoning and we will show that our framework is appropriate for software implementation by proving important decidability properties.},

We explain how these structures support a notion of scalar which allows quantitative aspects of physical theory to be expressed, and how the notion of strong compact closure emerges as a significant refinement of the more classical notion of compact closed category. We then proceed to an extended discussion of free constructions for a sequence of progressively more complex kinds of structured category, culminating in the strongly compact closed case. The simple geometric and combinatorial ideas underlying these constructions are emphasized. We also discuss variations where a prescribed monoid of scalars can be "glued in" to the free construction.},

For us an "open" Petri net is one with certain places designated as inputs and outputs via a cospan of sets. We can compose open Petri nets by gluing the outputs of one to the inputs of another. Open Petri nets can be treated as morphisms of a category \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{Open\}({\textbackslash}mathsf\{Petri\})\$, which becomes symmetric monoidal under disjoint union. However, since the composite of open Petri nets is defined only up to isomorphism, it is better to treat them as morphisms of a symmetric monoidal double category \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{O\}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{pen\}({\textbackslash}mathsf\{Petri\})\$. We describe two forms of semantics for open Petri nets using symmetric monoidal double functors out of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{O\}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{pen\}({\textbackslash}mathsf\{Petri\})\$. The first, an operational semantics, gives for each open Petri net a category whose morphisms are the processes that this net can carry out. This is done in a compositional way, so that these categories can be computed on smaller subnets and then glued together. The second, a reachability semantics, simply says which markings of the outputs can be reached from a given marking of the inputs.},

This is achieved by extending the representations of words from points in meaning space to density operators, which are probability distributions on the subspaces of the space. A symmetric measure of similarity and an asymmetric measure of entailment is defined, where lexical entailment is measured using von Neumann entropy, the quantum variant of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Lexical entailment, combined with the composition map on word representations, provides a method to obtain entailment relations on the level of sentences. Truth theoretic and corpus-based examples are provided.},

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

Using a range of imaginative and deceptively simple linguistic analyses, Chomsky defends the view that knowledge of language is internal to the human mind. He argues that a proper study of language must deal with this mental construct. According to Chomsky, therefore, human language is a 'biological object' and should be analyzed using the methodology of the sciences. His examples and analyses come together in this book to give a unique and compelling perspective on language and the mind.},

To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model PaLM. We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.},

What should they do when most of the low hanging fruit has been pretty much picked over?  In the particular case of Machine Translation, the revival of statistical approaches (e.g., Brown et al. (1993)) started out with finite-state methods for pragmatic reasons, but gradually over time, researchers have become more and more receptive to the use of syntax to capture long-distance dependences, especially when there isn't very much parallel corpora, and for language pairs with very different word orders (e.g., translating between a subject-verb-object (SVO) language like English and a verb final language like Japanese). Going forward, we should expect Machine Translation research to make more and more use of richer and richer linguistic representations. So too, there will soon be a day when stress will become important for speech recognition.  Since it isn't possible for textbooks in computational linguistics to cover all of these topics, we should work with colleagues in other departments to make sure that students receive an education that is broad enough to prepare them for all possible futures, or at least all probable futures.},

  abstract = {A lens is a functor equipped with a suitable choice of lifts, generalising the notion of a split opfibration. Lenses were first introduced in computer science to model bidirectional transformations between systems, and this thesis contributes to an ongoing initiative to understand lenses using category theory. Specifically, we study the mathematical structure of lenses using double categories, and use this to generalise the theory of lenses to new and useful settings. Arguably the most fundamental characterisation of lenses, due to Ahman and Uustalu, is as a compatible functor and cofunctor pair. We introduce the flat double category of cofunctors --- consisting of categories, functors, and cofunctors --- and examine several of its basic properties. Right-connected double categories were first introduced in the study of algebraic weak factorisation systems, and we establish an explicit construction which completes a double category under this property. The double category of lenses is characterised as the right-connected completion of the double category of cofunctors, and we demonstrate how many properties of lenses are inherited from functors and cofunctors via this construction. In particular, the double category of cofunctors is strongly span representable, and this leads to a diagrammatic calculus for lenses using the right-connected completion. The Grothendieck construction, which yields split opfibrations, is among the most useful notions in category theory, and we introduce a generalised Grothendieck construction for lenses. Given a double category equipped with a functorial choice of companions, its left-connected completion is shown to admit a universal property with respect to lax double functors. The double category of split multi-valued functions is introduced as the left-connected completion of the double category of spans, and we prove that lax double functors into this double category correspond to lenses using the aforementioned universal property. It is well known that functors between categories naturally arise as monad morphisms in the double category of spans, providing the basis for useful generalisations such as internal categories. We introduce the notion of monad retromorphism, and show that in the double category of spans, monad retromorphisms are precisely cofunctors. Using the right-connected completion, lenses between monads are defined, and they are used to develop the theory of lenses and split opfibrations in internal category theory. It is natural to ask if any functor or cofunctor may be equipped with the structure of a lens. We show that lenses arise as both algebras for a monad, and coalgebras for a comonad. It follows that a lens is a functor with additional algebraic structure, and also a cofunctor with additional coalgebraic structure. In particular, the monad for lenses generates an algebraic weak factorisation system, for which every functor factorises through its corresponding free lens. The link between lenses and algebraic weak factorisations systems provides a new setting in which many of the properties of lenses can be understood. While lenses are a generalisation of the notion of split opfibration, the results in this thesis also have implications for split opfibrations themselves, including new characterisations using d{\'e}calage, strict factorisation systems, and lax double functors. Altogether, the thesis demonstrates that double categories provide a valuable unified framework for the theory of lenses.},

The concept of a Turing category first appeared (albeit not under that name or at the level of generality we present it here) in the work of Longo and Moggi; later, Di Paolo and Heller introduced the closely related recursion categories. One of the purposes of Turing categories is that they may be used to develop categorical formulations of recursion theory, but they also include other notions of computation, such as models of (partial) combinatory logic and of the (partial) lambda calculus. In this paper our aim is to give an introduction to the basic structural theory, while at the same time illustrating how the notion is a meeting point for various other areas of logic and computation. We also provide a detailed exposition of the connection between Turing categories and partial combinatory algebras and show the sense in which the study of Turing categories is equivalent to the study of PCAs.},

The objects represent physical systems, the morphisms physical operations, whereas the tensors describe composite systems. Classical data turn out to correspond to Frobenius algebras with some additional properties. They express the distinguishing capabilities of classical data: in contrast with quantum data, classical data can be copied and deleted. The algebraic approach thus shifts the paradigm of "quantization" of a classical theory to "classicization" of a quantum theory. Remarkably, the simple SDM framework suffices not only for this conceptual shift, but even allows us to distinguish the deterministic classical operations (i.e. functions) from the nondeterministic classical operations (i.e. relations), and the probabilistic classical operations (stochastic maps). Moreover, a combination of some basic categorical constructions (due to Kleisli, resp. Grothendieck) with the categorical presentations of quantum states, provides a resource sensitive account of various quantum-classical interactions: of classical control of quantum data, of classical data arising from quantum measurements, as well as of the classical data processing in-between controls and measurements. A salient feature here is the graphical calculus for categorical quantum mechanics, which allows a purely diagrammatic representation of classical-quantum interaction.},

Inspired by work on compositionality in quantum theory, and categorical quantum mechanics in particular, we propose the notions of Schrodinger, Whitehead, and complete compositionality. Accounting for recent important developments in quantum technology and artificial intelligence, these do not have the bottom-up meaning flow as part of their definitions. Schrodinger compositionality accommodates quantum theory, and also meaning-as-context. Complete compositionality further strengthens Schrodinger compositionality in order to single out theories like ZX-calculus, that are complete with regard to the intended model. All together, our new notions aim to capture the fact that compositionality is at its best when it is `real', `non-trivial', and even more when it also is `complete'. At this point we only put forward the intuitive and/or restricted formal definitions, and leave a fully comprehensive definition to future collaborative work.},

Concretely, the type reductions of Pregroups are `lifted' to morphisms in a category, a procedure that transforms meanings of constituents into a meaning of the (well-typed) whole. Importantly, meanings of whole sentences live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence the inner-product can be used to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences, as it is for comparing the meanings of words in the distributional model. The mathematical structure we employ admits a purely diagrammatic calculus which exposes how the information flows between the words in a sentence in order to make up the meaning of the whole sentence. A variation of our `categorical model' which involves constraining the scalars of the vector spaces to the semiring of Booleans results in a Montague-style Boolean-valued semantics.},

  abstract = {In previous work we gave a mathematical foundation, referred to as DisCoCat, for how words interact in a sentence in order to produce the meaning of that sentence. To do so, we exploited the perfect structural match of grammar and categories of meaning spaces. Here, we give a mathematical foundation, referred to as DisCoCirc, for how sentences interact in texts in order to produce the meaning of that text. First we revisit DisCoCat. While in DisCoCat all meanings are fixed as states (i.e. have no input), in DisCoCirc word meanings correspond to a type, or system, and the states of this system can evolve. Sentences are gates within a circuit which update the variable meanings of those words. Like in DisCoCat, word meanings can live in a variety of spaces e.g. propositional, vectorial, or cognitive. The compositional structure are string diagrams representing information flows, and an entire text yields a single string diagram in which word meanings lift to the meaning of an entire text. While the developments in this paper are independent of a physical embodiment (cf. classical vs. quantum computing), both the compositional formalism and suggested meaning model are highly quantum-inspired, and implementation on a quantum computer would come with a range of benefits. We also praise Jim Lambek for his role in mathematical linguistics in general, and the development of the DisCo program more specifically.},

The basis is normalised exactly when the corresponding commutative dagger-Frobenius monoid is special. Hence orthogonal and orthonormal bases can be axiomatised in terms of composition of operations and tensor product only, without any explicit reference to the underlying vector spaces. This axiomatisation moreover admits an operational interpretation, as the comultiplication copies the basis vectors and the counit uniformly deletes them. That is, we rely on the distinct ability to clone and delete classical data as compared to quantum data to capture basis vectors. For this reason our result has important implications for categorical quantum mechanics.},

  abstract = {We define novel fully combinatorial models of higher categories. Our definitions are based on a connection of higher categories to "directed spaces". Directed spaces are locally modelled on manifold diagrams, which are stratifications of the n-cube such that strata are transversal to the flag foliation of the n-cube. The first part of this thesis develops a combinatorial model for manifold diagrams called singular n-cubes. In the second part we apply this model to build our notions of higher categories. Singular n-cubes are "directed triangulations" of space together with a decomposition into a collection of subspaces or strata. Singular n-cubes can be naturally organised into two categories. The first, whose morphisms are bundles themselves, is used for the inductive definition of singular (n+1)-cubes. The second, whose morphisms are "open" base changes, admits an (epi,mono) factorisation system. Monomorphisms will be called embeddings of cubes. Epimorphisms will be called collapses and describe how triangulations can be coarsened. Each cube has a unique coarsest triangulation called its normal form. The existence of normal forms makes the equality relation of (combinatorially represented) manifold diagrams decidable. As the main application of the resulting combinatorial framework for manifold diagrams, we give algebraic definitions of various notions of higher categories. Namely, we define associative n-categories, presented associative n-categories and presented associative n-groupoids. All three notions will have strict units and associators; the only weak coherences are homotopies, but we develop a mechanism for recovering the usual coherence data of weak n-categories, such as associators and pentagonators and their higher analogues. This will motivate the conjecture that the theory of associative higher categories is equivalent to its fully weak counterpart.},

Broadly, a neural network will be better at learning to execute a reasoning task (in terms of sample complexity) if its individual components align well with the target algorithm. Specifically, GNNs are claimed to align with dynamic programming (DP), a general problem-solving strategy which expresses many polynomial-time algorithms. However, has this alignment truly been demonstrated and theoretically quantified? Here we show, using methods from category theory and abstract algebra, that there exists an intricate connection between GNNs and DP, going well beyond the initial observations over individual algorithms such as Bellman-Ford. Exposing this connection, we easily verify several prior findings in the literature, produce better-grounded GNN architectures for edge-centric tasks, and demonstrate empirical results on the CLRS algorithmic reasoning benchmark. We hope our exposition will serve as a foundation for building stronger algorithmically aligned GNNs.},

Yet, these models simultaneously show failures on surprisingly trivial problems. This begs the question: Are these errors incidental, or do they signal more substantial limitations? In an attempt to demystify Transformers, we investigate the limits of these models across three representative compositional tasks -- multi-digit multiplication, logic grid puzzles, and a classic dynamic programming problem. These tasks require breaking problems down into sub-steps and synthesizing these steps into a precise answer. We formulate compositional tasks as computation graphs to systematically quantify the level of complexity, and break down reasoning steps into intermediate sub-procedures. Our empirical findings suggest that Transformers solve compositional tasks by reducing multi-step compositional reasoning into linearized subgraph matching, without necessarily developing systematic problem-solving skills. To round off our empirical study, we provide theoretical arguments on abstract multi-step reasoning problems that highlight how Transformers' performance will rapidly decay with increased task complexity.},

As the boundaries between life online and offline break down, and we become seamlessly connected to each other and surrounded by smart, responsive objects, we are all becoming integrated into an "infosphere". Personas we adopt in social media, for example, feed into our 'real' lives so that we begin to live, as Floridi puts in, "onlife". Following those led by Copernicus, Darwin, and Freud, this metaphysical shift represents nothing less than a fourth revolution.  "Onlife" defines more and more of our daily activity - the way we shop, work, learn, care for our health, entertain ourselves, conduct our relationships; the way we interact with the worlds of law, finance, and politics; even the way we conduct war. In every department of life, ICTs have become environmental forces which are creating and transforming our realities. How can we ensure that we shall reap their benefits? What are the implicit risks? Are our technologies going to enable and empower us, or constrain us? Floridi argues that we must expand our ecological and ethical approach to cover both natural and man-made realities, putting the 'e' in an environmentalism that can deal successfully with the new challenges posed by our digital technologies and information society.},

  abstract = {Explores differences between connectionist proposals for cognitive architecture and the models that have traditionally been assumed in cognitive science. It is asserted that the major distinction is that, while both connectionist and classical architectures postulate representational mental states, only the latter is committed to a symbol level of representation, or to a language of thought. It is claimed that arguments for combinational structure in mental representations make a powerful case that mind/brain architecture is not connectionist at the cognitive level. The possibility is considered that connectionism may provide an account of the neural structures in which classical cognitive architecture is implemented. It is concluded that the standard arguments offered in favor of connectionism are coherent only on this interpretation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Hypergraph categories have been rediscovered at least five times, under various names, including well-supported compact closed categories, dgs-monoidal categories, and dungeon categories. Perhaps the reason they keep being reinvented is two-fold: there are many applications---including to automata, databases, circuits, linear relations, graph rewriting, and belief propagation---and yet the standard definition is so involved and ornate as to be difficult to find in the literature. Indeed, a hypergraph category is, roughly speaking, a "symmetric monoidal category in which each object is equipped with the structure of a special commutative Frobenius monoid, satisfying certain coherence conditions". Fortunately, this description can be simplified a great deal: a hypergraph category is simply a "cospan-algebra". The goal of this paper is to remove the scare-quotes and make the previous statement precise. We prove two main theorems. First is a coherence theorem for hypergraph categories, which says that every hypergraph category is equivalent to an objectwise-free hypergraph category. Second, we prove that the category of objectwise-free hypergraph categories is equivalent to the category of cospan-algebras.},

The main goal of this paper is conceptual: to fill a foundational gap in reasoning about digital circuits, which is currently almost exclusively semantic (simulations). The level of abstraction we target is circuits with discrete signal levels, discrete time, and explicit delays, which is appropriate for modelling a range of components such as boolean gates or transistors working in saturation mode. We start with an algebraic signature consisting of the basic electronic components of a given class of circuits and extend it gradually (and in a free way) with further algebraic structure (representing circuit combinations, delays, and feedback), while quotienting it with a notion of equivalence corresponding to input-output observability. Using well-known results about the correspondence between free monoidal categories and graph-like structures we can develop, in a principled way, a graph rewriting system which is shown to be useful in reasoning about such circuits. We illustrate the power of our system by reasoning equationally about a challenging class of circuits: combinational circuits with feedback.},

In this paper we show that in addition lenses are the coalgebras for the comonad generated by the cartesian closure adjunction on Set. We present a fully constructive proof of the coalgebra correspondence, we note that the algebra correspondence extends to arbitrary categories with products and that the coalgebra correspondence extends to arbitrary cartesian closed categories, and we show that both correspondences extend to isomorphisms of categories. The resulting isomorphism between a category of algebras and a category of coalgebras is unexpected, and we analyze it isolating its underlying generality, and also the particularity that restricts its applicability. We end with remarks about the utility of the two different treatments of lenses,especially for obtaining further, more realistic, generalizations of the notion of lens.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

This leads to a compositional theory in which we can reason about properties of games in terms of corresponding properties of the component parts. In particular, we give a definition of Nash equilibrium which is recursive on the causal structure of the game. The key technical idea in this paper is the use of continuation passing style for reasoning about the future consequences of players' choices, closely based on applications of selection functions in game theory.

As a foundation for a proof assistant, this is potentially attractive, since it has the potential to allow simple formal proofs of complex high-dimensional algebraic phenomena. However, the theory relies on an implicit term normalisation procedure to recognize correct composites, with no recursive method available for computing it. Here we describe a new approach to term normalisation in associative \$n\$-categories, based on the categorical zigzag construction. This radically simplifies the theory, and yields a recursive algorithm for normalisation, which we prove is correct. Our use of categorical lifting properties allows us to give efficient proofs of our results. This normalisation algorithm forms a core component of the proof assistant homotopy.io, and we illustrate our scheme with worked examples.},

Each problem in MATH has a full step-by-step solution which can be used to teach models to generate answer derivations and explanations. To facilitate future research and increase accuracy on MATH, we also contribute a large auxiliary pretraining dataset which helps teach models the fundamentals of mathematics. Even though we are able to increase accuracy on MATH, our results show that accuracy remains relatively low, even with enormous Transformer models. Moreover, we find that simply increasing budgets and model parameter counts will be impractical for achieving strong mathematical reasoning if scaling trends continue. While scaling Transformers is automatically solving most other text-based tasks, scaling is not currently solving MATH. To have more traction on mathematical problem solving we will likely need new algorithmic advancements from the broader research community.},

These facts led to the widespread notion that the human brain is literally extraordinary: an outlier among mammalian brains, defying evolutionary rules that apply to other species, with a uniqueness seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over mammals with even larger brains. These facts, with deep implications for neurophysiology and evolutionary biology, are not grounded on solid evidence or sound assumptions, however. Our recent development of a method that allows rapid and reliable quantification of the numbers of cells that compose the whole brain has provided a means to verify these facts. Here, I review this recent evidence and argue that, with 86 billion neurons and just as many nonneuronal cells, the human brain is a scaled-up primate brain in its cellular composition and metabolic cost, with a relatively enlarged cerebral cortex that does not have a relatively larger number of brain neurons yet is remarkable in its cognitive abilities and metabolism simply because of its extremely large number of neurons.},

  abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.}

  abstract = {Extracting causal relationships from observed correlations is a growing area in probabilistic reasoning, originating with the seminal work of Pearl and others from the early 1990s. This paper develops a new, categorically oriented view based on a clear distinction between syntax (string diagrams) and semantics (stochastic matrices), connected via interpretations as structure-preserving functors. A key notion in the identification of causal effects is that of an intervention, whereby a variable is forcefully set to a particular value independent of any prior propensities. We represent the effect of such an intervention as an endofunctor which performs `string diagram surgery' within the syntactic category of string diagrams. This diagram surgery in turn yields a new, interventional distribution via the interpretation functor. While in general there is no way to compute interventional distributions purely from observed data, we show that this is possible in certain special cases using a calculational tool called comb disintegration. We demonstrate the use of this technique on a well-known toy example, where we predict the causal effect of smoking on cancer in the presence of a confounding common cause. After developing this specific example, we show this technique provides simple sufficient conditions for computing interventions which apply to a wide variety of situations considered in the causal inference literature.},

Our coherence results are formulated using the structure of n-categories enriched in double groupoids, whose horizontal cells represent rewriting paths, vertical cells represent the congruence generated by the axioms and square cells represent coherence cells induced by diagrams of confluence modulo.

It turns out that 1-category theory is not the most appropriate vehicle for studying the interplay of extension and intension. We are thus led to consider the P-categories of {\textbackslash}v\{C\}ubri{\textbackslash}'\{c\}, Dybjer and Scott, which are categories only up to a partial equivalence relation (PER). In this setting, we introduce a new P-categorical construct, that of exposures. Exposures are very nearly functors, except that they do not preserve the PERs of the P-category. Inspired by the categorical semantics of modal logic, we begin to develop their theory. Our leading examples demonstrate that an exposure is an abstraction of well-behaved intensional devices, such as G{\textbackslash}"odel numberings. The outcome is a unifying framework in which classic results of Kleene, G{\textbackslash}"odel, Tarski and Rice find concise, clear formulations, and where each logical device or assumption involved in their proofs can be expressed in the same algebraic manner.},

  abstract = {Increase in computational scale and fine-tuning has seen a dramatic improvement in the quality of outputs of large language models (LLMs) like GPT. Given that both GPT-3 and GPT-4 were trained on large quantities of human-generated text, we might ask to what extent their outputs reflect patterns of human thinking, both for correct and incorrect cases. The Erotetic Theory of Reason (ETR) provides a symbolic generative model of both human success and failure in thinking, across propositional, quantified, and probabilistic reasoning, as well as decision-making. We presented GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 with 61 central inference and judgment problems from a recent book-length presentation of ETR, consisting of experimentally verified data-points on human judgment and extrapolated data-points predicted by ETR, with correct inference patterns as well as fallacies and framing effects (the ETR61 benchmark). ETR61 includes classics like Wason's card task, illusory inferences, the decoy effect, and opportunity-cost neglect, among others. GPT-3 showed evidence of ETR-predicted outputs for 59\% of these examples, rising to 77\% in GPT-3.5 and 75\% in GPT-4. Remarkably, the production of human-like fallacious judgments increased from 18\% in GPT-3 to 33\% in GPT-3.5 and 34\% in GPT-4. This suggests that larger and more advanced LLMs may develop a tendency toward more human-like mistakes, as relevant thought patterns are inherent in human-produced training data. According to ETR, the same fundamental patterns are involved both in successful and unsuccessful ordinary reasoning, so that the "bad" cases could paradoxically be learned from the "good" cases. We further present preliminary evidence that ETR-inspired prompt engineering could reduce instances of these mistakes.},

These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterised by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions.

In this paper we exploit the fact that in geography, ground truths are available beyond local relations. In a series of experiments, we evaluate the extent to which language model representations of city and country names are isomorphic to real-world geography, e.g., if you tell a language model where Paris and Berlin are, does it know the way to Rome? We find that language models generally encode limited geographic information, but with larger models performing the best, suggesting that geographic knowledge can be induced from higher-order co-occurrence statistics.},

  abstract = {The framework of causal models provides a principled approach to causal reasoning, applied today across many scientific domains. Here we present this framework in the language of string diagrams, interpreted formally using category theory. A class of string diagrams, called network diagrams, are in 1-to-1 correspondence with directed acyclic graphs. A causal model is given by such a diagram with its components interpreted as stochastic maps, functions, or general channels in a symmetric monoidal category with a 'copy-discard' structure (cd-category), turning a model into a single mathematical object that can be reasoned with intuitively and yet rigorously. Building on prior works by Fong and Jacobs, Kissinger and Zanasi, as well as Fritz and Klingler, we present diagrammatic definitions of causal models and functional causal models in a cd-category, generalising causal Bayesian networks and structural causal models, respectively. We formalise general interventions on a model, including but beyond do-interventions, and present the natural notion of an open causal model with inputs. We also give an approach to conditioning based on a normalisation box, allowing for causal inference calculations to be done fully diagrammatically. We define counterfactuals in this setup, and treat the problems of the identifiability of causal effects and counterfactuals fully diagrammatically. The benefits of such a presentation of causal models lie in foundational questions in causal reasoning and in their clarificatory role and pedagogical value. This work aims to be accessible to different communities, from causal model practitioners to researchers in applied category theory, and discusses many examples from the literature for illustration. Overall, we argue and demonstrate that causal reasoning according to the causal model framework is most naturally and intuitively done as diagrammatic reasoning.},

In this paper, we present results on the first NLP experiments conducted on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers for datasets of size greater than 100 sentences. Exploiting the formal similarity of the compositional model of meaning by Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark (2010) with quantum theory, we create representations for sentences that have a natural mapping to quantum circuits. We use these representations to implement and successfully train NLP models that solve simple sentence classification tasks on quantum hardware. We conduct quantum simulations that compare the syntax-sensitive model of Coecke et al. with two baselines that use less or no syntax; specifically, we implement the quantum analogues of a "bag-of-words" model, where syntax is not taken into account at all, and of a word-sequence model, where only word order is respected. We demonstrate that all models converge smoothly both in simulations and when run on quantum hardware, and that the results are the expected ones based on the nature of the tasks and the datasets used. Another important goal of this paper is to describe in a way accessible to AI and NLP researchers the main principles, process and challenges of experiments on quantum hardware. Our aim in doing this is to take the first small steps in this unexplored research territory and pave the way for practical Quantum Natural Language Processing.},

  abstract = {Today's large language models (LLMs) routinely generate coherent, grammatical and seemingly meaningful paragraphs of text. This achievement has led to speculation that these networks are -- or will soon become -- "thinking machines", capable of performing tasks that require abstract knowledge and reasoning. Here, we review the capabilities of LLMs by considering their performance on two different aspects of language use: 'formal linguistic competence', which includes knowledge of rules and patterns of a given language, and 'functional linguistic competence', a host of cognitive abilities required for language understanding and use in the real world. Drawing on evidence from cognitive neuroscience, we show that formal competence in humans relies on specialized language processing mechanisms, whereas functional competence recruits multiple extralinguistic capacities that comprise human thought, such as formal reasoning, world knowledge, situation modeling, and social cognition. In line with this distinction, LLMs show impressive (although imperfect) performance on tasks requiring formal linguistic competence, but fail on many tests requiring functional competence. Based on this evidence, we argue that (1) contemporary LLMs should be taken seriously as models of formal linguistic skills; (2) models that master real-life language use would need to incorporate or develop not only a core language module, but also multiple non-language-specific cognitive capacities required for modeling thought. Overall, a distinction between formal and functional linguistic competence helps clarify the discourse surrounding LLMs' potential and provides a path toward building models that understand and use language in human-like ways.},

Researchers from a range of brain and cognitive sciences have long valued Marr's creativity, intellectual power, and ability to integrate insights and data from neuroscience, psychology, and computation. This MIT Press edition makes Marr's influential work available to a new generation of students and scientists. In Marr's framework, the process of vision constructs a set of representations, starting from a description of the input image and culminating with a description of three-dimensional objects in the surrounding environment. A central theme, and one that has had far-reaching influence in both neuroscience and cognitive science, is the notion of different levels of analysis---in Marr's framework, the computational level, the algorithmic level, and the hardware implementation level. Now, thirty years later, the main problems that occupied Marr remain fundamental open problems in the study of perception. Vision provides inspiration for the continuing efforts to integrate knowledge from cognition and computation to understand vision and the brain.},

We present a conceptually motivated parameterized framework for the construction of models for process theories. Our framework generalizes the notion of binary relation along four axes of variation, the truth values, a choice of algebraic structure, the ambient mathematical universe and the choice of proof relevance or provability. The resulting categories are preorder-enriched and provide analogues of relational converse and taking graphs of maps. Our constructions are functorial in the parameter choices, establishing mathematical connections between different application domains. We illustrate our techniques by constructing many existing models from the literature, and new models that open up ground for further development.},

In principle, this graphical notation should encompass the various pictorial systems introduced in proof-theory (like Jean-Yves Girard's proof-nets) and in concurrency theory (like Robin Milner's bigraphs). This is not the case however, at least because string diagrams do not accomodate boxes --- a key ingredient in these pictorial systems. In this short tutorial, based on our accidental rediscovery of an idea by Robin Cockett and Robert Seely, we explain how string diagrams may be extended with a notion of functorial box depicting a functor transporting an inside world (its source category) to an outside world (its target category). We expose two elementary applications of the notation: first, we characterize graphically when a faithful balanced monoidal functor F:{$\mathbb{C}$} \${\textbackslash}longrightarrow\$\${\textbackslash}mathbb\{D\}\$transports a trace operator from the category \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{D\}\$to the category {$\mathbb{C}$}, and exploit this to construct well-behaved fixpoint operators in cartesian closed categories generated by models of linear logic; second, we explain how the categorical semantics of linear logic induces that the exponential box of proof-nets decomposes as two enshrined boxes.},

In this paper we present three new neural models for learning density matrices from a corpus, and test their ability to discriminate between word senses on a range of compositional datasets. When paired with a particular composition method, our best model outperforms existing vector-based compositional models as well as strong sentence encoders.},

  urldate = {2023-06-25},
  abstract = {This thesis looks at two quantum motivated graphical calculi, the ZW calculus and ZX calculus. These two calculi are intended to perform qubit calculations using string diagrams. Both calculi are universal in the sense that they are able to represent all qubit maps, but they lack the completeness which means that they don't allow all qubit computation. The main goal of the thesis is to address the completeness issue. The ZW calculus was completed by Hadzihasanovic in his DPhil thesis. We build on his work to do a completion for a fragment of the ZW calculus which describes operations in the fermionic quantum circuits. In the process, we discovered an important family of maps, the even and odd projectors. The even projectors is particularly important for the completion process. Next, we further restrict the calculus to only "even" maps and complete this fragment too. The odd projectors are important for this completion process. We give an interesting story for the even fragment ZW calculus: it describes a world without "real" particles, and the fermionic particles are manifestation of the curvature of spacetime and self 'fermionic' intersection and interaction of spacetime. The ZX calculus was not complete and we solve this issue in this thesis. The technique used is a refinement of the one used in the paper on 'A Complete Axiomatisation of the ZX-Calculus for Clifford+T Quantum Mechanics' by Jeandel, Perdrix, and Vilmart. The basic idea of the technique is to translate the ZX calculus to the ZW calculus to analyse the problem, then translate it back. We also obtained many interesting generalising results which includes the completeness for the Clifford+T fragment and any fragments containing the Clifford+T fragment. Finally, we end off with some interesting possible continuation of the thesis. Many of them are low hanging fruits. One of them is the extension of the calculi to represent qudits maps. The other is to generalise the ZW calculus to take semi-ring parameters which may be suited for other areas of computer science.},

It provides a succinct categorical interface to most of them, free of their diverse implementation details, using the ideas and structures that in the meantime emerged from research in semantics of computation and programming. The salient feature of the language of monoidal categories is that it is supported by a sound and complete graphical formalism, string diagrams, which provide a concrete and intuitive interface for abstract reasoning about computation. The original motivation and the ultimate goal of this effort is to provide a convenient high level programming language for a theory of computational resources, such as one-way functions, and trapdoor functions, by adopting the methods for hiding the low level implementation details that emerged from practice. In the present paper, we make a first step towards this ambitious goal, and sketch a path to reach it. This path is pursued in three sequel papers, that are in preparation.},

In the present paper, we refine and extend that model of computation to support a formal complexity theory as well. This formalization brings to the foreground the concept of normal complexity measures, which allow decompositions akin to Kleene's normal form. Such measures turn out to be just those where evaluating the complexity of a program does not require substantially more resources than evaluating the program itself. The usual time and space complexity are thus normal measures, whereas the average and the randomized complexity measures are not. While the measures that are not normal provide important design time information about algorithms, and for theoretical analyses, normal measures can also be used at run time, as practical tools of computation, e.g. to set the bounds for hypothesis testing, inductive inference and algorithmic learning.},

The upshot of yet another model of computation is that a categorical formalism should provide a much needed high level language for theory of computation, flexible enough to allow abstracting away the low level implementation details when they are irrelevant, or taking them into account when they are genuinely needed. A salient feature of the approach through monoidal categories is the formal graphical language of string diagrams, which supports visual reasoning about programs and computations. In the present paper, we provide a coalgebraic characterization of monoidal computer. It turns out that the availability of interpreters and specializers, that make a monoidal category into a monoidal computer, is equivalent with the existence of a *universal state space*, that carries a weakly final state machine for any pair of input and output types. Being able to program state machines in monoidal computers allows us to represent Turing machines, to capture their execution, count their steps, as well as, e.g., the memory cells that they use. The coalgebraic view of monoidal computer thus provides a convenient diagrammatic language for studying computability and complexity.},

Furthermore, it is a complete graphical rewrite system: any equation involving linear maps that is derivable in the Hilbert space formalism for quantum theory can also be derived in the calculus by rewriting. It has widespread usage within quantum industry and academia for a variety of tasks such as quantum circuit optimisation, error-correction, and education. The ZW-calculus is an alternative universal graphical language that is also complete for qubit quantum computing. In fact, its completeness was used to prove that the ZX-calculus is universally complete. This calculus has advanced how quantum circuits are compiled into photonic hardware architectures in the industry. Recently, by combining these two calculi, a new calculus has emerged for qubit quantum computation, the ZXW-calculus. Using this calculus, graphical-differentiation, -integration, and -exponentiation were made possible, thus enabling the development of novel techniques in the domains of quantum machine learning and quantum chemistry. Here, we generalise the ZXW-calculus to arbitrary finite dimensions, that is, to qudits. Moreover, we prove that this graphical rewrite system is complete for any finite dimension. This is the first completeness result for any universal graphical language beyond qubits.},

  abstract = {A combinatorial theory of associative \$n\$-categories has recently been proposed, with strictly associative and unital composition in all dimensions, and the weak structure arising as a combinatorial notion of homotopy with a natural geometrical interpretation. Such a theory has the potential to serve as an attractive foundation for a computer proof assistant for higher category theory, since it allows composites to be uniquely described, and relieves proofs from the bureaucracy of associators, unitors and their coherence. However, this basic theory lacks a high-level way to construct homotopies, which would be intractable to build directly in complex situations; it is not therefore immediately amenable to implementation. We tackle this problem by describing a contraction operation, which algorithmically constructs complex homotopies that reduce the lengths of composite terms. This contraction procedure allows building of nontrivial proofs by repeatedly contracting subterms, and also allows the contraction of those proofs themselves, yielding in some cases single-step witnesses for complex homotopies. We prove correctness of this procedure by showing that it lifts connected colimits from a base category to a category of zigzags, a procedure which is then iterated to yield a contraction mechanism in any dimension. We also present homotopy.io, an online proof assistant that implements the theory of associative \$n\$-categories, and use it to construct a range of examples that illustrate this new contraction mechanism.},

(2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. These two propositions have the following consequences: (3) The explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 1 and 2. (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1. (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong AI) could not succeed just by designing programs but would have to duplicate the causal powers of the human brain. This follows from 2 and 4.``Could a machine think?'' On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains. And that is why strong AI has little to tell us about thinking, since it is not about machines but about programs, and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking.},

While many attacked Searle's Chinese Room thought experiment, no one seemed to question this most basic assumption. For how can computers learn something that is not in the data? Emily Bender and Alexander Koller (2020) recently presented a related thought experiment---the so-called Octopus thought experiment, which replaces the rule-based interlocutor of Searle's thought experiment with a neural language model. The Octopus thought experiment was awarded a best paper prize and was widely debated in the AI community. Again, however, even its fiercest opponents accepted the premise that what a word refers to cannot be induced in the absence of direct supervision. I will argue that what a word refers to is~probably learnable from raw text alone. Here's why: higher-order concept co-occurrence statistics are stable across languages and across modalities, because language use (universally) reflects the world we live in (which is relatively stable). Such statistics are sufficient to establish what words refer to. My conjecture is supported by a literature survey, a thought experiment, and an actual experiment.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns the structure of meanings within natural language. In [13] a framework for natural language named DisCoCirc was sketched that has the following features: (1) it is both compositional and distributional (a.k.a. vectorial); (2) it applies to general text, not just sentences; (3) it captures linguistic `connections' between meanings (cf. grammar); (4) word meanings get updated as text progresses; (5) sentence types reflect the words that have their meaning updated; (6) language ambiguity is naturally accommodated. In this paper, we realise DisCoCirc for a substantial fragment of English. We moreover show that when passing to DisCoCirc's text circuits, some `grammatical bureaucracy' is eliminated. That is, DisCoCirc displays a significant degree of: (7) inter- and intra-language independence. By inter-language independence we mean for example independence from word-order conventions that differ across languages, and by intra-language independence we mean for example independence from choices like using many short sentences versus few long sentences. This inter-language independence means our text circuits should carry over to other languages, unlike the language-specific typings of categorial grammars. Hence, text circuits are a lean structure for the `actual substance of text', that is, the inner-workings of meanings within text across several layers of expressiveness (cf. words, sentences, text), and may capture that what is truly universal beneath grammar.},

Many important features of language have spatial connotations, for example, many prepositions (like in, next to, after, on, etc.) are fundamentally spatial. Space is also a key factor of the meanings of many words/phrases/sentences/text, and space is a, if not the key, context for referencing (e.g. pointing) and embodiment. We propose a mechanism for how space and linguistic structure can be made to interact in a matching compositional fashion. Examples include Cartesian space, subway stations, chesspieces on a chess-board, and Penrose's staircase. The starting point for our construction is the DisCoCat model of compositional natural language meaning, which we relax to accommodate physical space. We address the issue of having multiple agents/objects in a space, including the case that each agent has different capabilities with respect to that space, e.g., the specific moves each chesspiece can make, or the different velocities one may be able to reach. Once our model is in place, we show how inferences drawing from the structure of physical space can be made. We also how how linguistic model of space can interact with other such models related to our senses and/or embodiment, such as the conceptual spaces of colour, taste and smell, resulting in a rich compositional model of meaning that is close to human experience and embodiment in the world.},

Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter language model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.},

In doing so, we shift the focus from special commutative dagger-Frobenius algebras to interacting (co)magma (co)module pairs, showing that the algebraic properties of the (co)multiplication arise from the module-comodule interaction, rather than direct assumptions about the magma-comagma pair. We then begin to investigate the zoo of possible update structures, introducing the notions of classical security-flagged databases, and databases of quantum systems. This work is of foundational interest as update structures place previously distinct areas of research in a general class of operationally motivated structures, we expect the taming of this class to illuminate novel relationships between separately studied topics in computer science, physics and mathematics.},

Topics covered include basic graph theory, basic category theory, colored operads, and algebras over colored operads. Free colored operads are discussed in complete detail and in full generality.The intended audience of this book includes students and researchers in mathematics and other sciences where operads and colored operads are used. The prerequisite for this book is minimal. Every major concept is thoroughly motivated. There are many graphical illustrations and about 150 exercises.
