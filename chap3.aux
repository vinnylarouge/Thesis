The construction yields as a corollary an alternate proof of Theorem 6.1.1 of \citep  {joshi_introduction_1987} that recovers CFGs as TAGs. \begin  {corollary} For every context-free grammar $\mathfrak  {G}$ there exists a tree-adjoining grammar $\mathfrak  {G}'$ such that $\mathfrak  {G}$ and $\mathfrak  {G}'$ are strongly equivalent -- both formalisms generate the same set of strings (weak equivalence) and the same abstract syntactic structures (in this case, trees) behind the strings (strong equivalence). \begin  {proof} Proposition \ref  {prop:cfgastag1} provides one direction of both equivalences. For the other direction, we have to show that each auxiliary tree (a 2-cell) and its adjoining operation (a 3-cell) in $\mathfrak  {G}'$ corresponds to a single 2-cell tree of some CFG signature $\mathfrak  {G}$, which we demonstrate by construction.

Joshi stresses that adjoining \emph  {preserves} links, and that elementary trees may become \emph  {stretched} in the process of derivation, which are fundamentally topological constraints, akin to the "only (processive) connectivity matters" criterion identifying string diagrams up to isomorphism. Moreover, TAGs evidently have links of two natures: tree edges intended to be planar, and dashed dependency edges intended to freely cross over tree edges. It is easy, but a hack, to ask for planar processive isomorphisms for tree edges and extraplanar behaviour for dependency edges: these are evidently two different kinds of structure glued together, rather than facets of some whole. Weak $n$-categories offer a unified mathematical framework that natively accommodates the desired topological constraints while also granting expressive control over wire-types of differing behaviours. One method to recover TAGs true to the original conception is to stay in a planar 1-object-2-category setting while explicitly including wire-crossing cells for dependency links. The alternative method we opt for in Section \ref  {sec:gencirc} is to work in a pure "only connectivity matters" setting, recovering the linear ordering of words by generating cells along a chosen wire. I do not know of any conceptual justification for why planarity is so often an implicit constraint in approaches to formal syntax. My best guesses are either that the first port of call for rewrites between 1-dimensional strings of words is a 2-dimensional setting, or it is a limitation of 2-dimensional paper as a medium of thought along with some confusion of map for territory.}}{20}{figure.caption.15}\protected@file@percent }

In the process of interpretation, we introduce a link wire-type (in purple), and include directed link generation and elimination morphisms for the $T$ wire-type (in blue). A necessary step in the process of interpretation (which for us involves taking a Poincar\'{e} dual to interpret nodes as wires) is a typing assignment of the tree-branches connected to terminal nodes, which we have opted to read as sharing a $T$-type for minimality, though we could just as well have introduced a separate label-type wire.}}{21}{figure.caption.16}\protected@file@percent }

The reason for this is that under- and over-braids still exist in the symmetric monoidal setting, and while sequentially composed braids are homotopically equivalent to the pair of identities, they are not uniquely so, thus these homotopies must be input manually. By beginning at 4-cells (or higher, due to the stabilisation hypothesis \citep  {nlab_authors_stabilization_nodate}), braid-eliminations are unique up to homotopy and can be performed more easily in the proof assistant.}}{21}{figure.caption.17}\protected@file@percent }
