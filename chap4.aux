In Euclidean 3-space, we might model income as a clock-gated mechanism that deposits time-tokens serially into Vincent's possession, along with his agency as a gated chute, and the time cost of writing a thesis as a dispenser that requires a certain number of tokens to release a thesis-token into Vincent's possession. In this sketch model, one obtains short films for \texttt  {He used to waste his mornings but now he spends them writing}, or \texttt  {He once spent an evening writing but made no progress}. One can then ascertain certain consequences truth-theoretically; for instance that there is at least one morning that was not spent on writing, or that there is at least one evening spent on writing but not inside the slot that would help a thesis-release mechanism trigger. In every case, cofunctoriality handles bookkeeping for role-interpretation choices and guarantees systematicity of the topological figure according to the signature at the apex model that models the organising concept.}}{12}{theorem.-1.1.4}\protected@file@percent }
