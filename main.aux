Whereas a group is a monoid with inverses up to left- and right-multiplication, a pregroup weakens the requirement for inverses so that all elements have distinct left- and right- inverses, denoted $x^{-1}$ and $^{-1}x$ respectively. Eliminating or introducing inverses is a non-identity relation on elements of the pregroup, so we have axioms of the form e.g. $x \cdot ^{-1}x \ \rightarrow \ 1 \ \rightarrow \ ^{-1}x \cdot x$. In this formulation, denoting the multiplication with a dot, both $(n/s)\setminus n$ and $(n/s)\setminus n$ become $^{-1}n \cdot s \cdot n^{-1}$, which just wants a noun to the left and a noun to the right in whatever order to eliminate the flanking inverses to reveal the embedded sentence type. Now we can obtain the same proof of correctness as a series of algebraic reductions.}}{35}{figure.caption.9}\protected@file@percent }

The basic types $n$ and $s$ are assigned finite-dimensional vector spaces, concatenation of types the Kronecker product $\otimes $, and by the isomorphism of dual spaces in finite dimensions there is no need to keep track of the left- and right- inverse data. Words become vectors, and pregroup reductions become bell-states, or bell-measurements, depending on whether one reads top-down or bottom-up.

A new point in the value proposition arose: that new mathematics would arise from investigating the linguistic-quantum bridge, e.g. generalised relations \citep  {marsdenCustomHypergraphCategories2017}. Although labelled as if it is the first in a series, the paper never saw a sequel by the same title, blocked by an apparently simple but actually tricky theoretical problem: while this convex-relational story worked for conceptual adjectives modifying a single noun (such as for "sweet yellow bananas"), there was difficulty in extending the story to work for multiple objects interacting in the same space, as in "cup on table in room". It couldn't be worked out what structure a sentence-wire in \textbf  {ConvexRel} ought to have in order to accommodate (in principle) arbitrarily many objects and spatial relations between them.}}{43}{figure.caption.20}\protected@file@percent }

Theoretically, seeking dynamic epistemic logic, Bob had an epiphanous hangover (really) where he envisioned that these "Cartesian verbs" could be used in service of compositional text meanings, and he called this idea DisCoCirc \citep  {coeckeMathematicsTextStructure2020a}.}}{44}{figure.caption.21}\protected@file@percent }
