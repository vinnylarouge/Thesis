The type formation rules for such a grammar are intuitive. Apart from a stock of basic types $\PazoBB  {B}$ that contains special final types to indicate sentences, we have two type formation operators $(-/=)$ and $(- \setminus =)$, which along with their elimination rules establish a requirement that grammatical categories require other grammatical categories to their left or right. This is the essence of Lambek's calculi \textbf  {NL} and \textbf  {L}.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {19}{\ignorespaces To eliminate this asymmetry, Lambek devised pregroup grammars. Whereas a group is a monoid with inverses up to left- and right-multiplication, a pregroup weakens the requirement for inverses so that all elements have distinct left- and right- inverses, denoted $x^{-1}$ and $^{-1}x$ respectively. Eliminating or introducing inverses is a non-identity relation on elements of the pregroup, so we have axioms of the form e.g. $x \cdot ^{-1}x \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow ^{1}x \cdot x$. In this formulation, denoting the multiplication with a dot, both $(n/s)\setminus n$ and $(n/s)\setminus n$ become $^{-1}n \cdot s \cdot n^{-1}$, which just wants a noun to the left and a noun to the right in whatever order to eliminate the flanking inverses to reveal the embedded sentence type. Now we can obtain the same proof of correctness as a series of algebraic reductions. \par \begin  {align*} & &n \cdot (^{-1}n \cdot s \cdot n^{-1}) \cdot n\\ &\rightarrow &(n \cdot ^{-1}n) \cdot s \cdot (n^{-1} \cdot n)\\ &\rightarrow & 1 \cdot s \cdot 1\\ &\rightarrow & s \end  {align*} }}{36}{subsection.0.7.1}\protected@file@percent }

Mediated by the linguistic expertise of Mehrnoosh who was a postdoctoral researcher in Oxford at the time, pregroup diagrams were born. The basic types $n$ and $s$ are assigned finite-dimensional vector spaces, concatenation of types the kronecker product $\otimes $, and by the isomorphism of dual spaces in finite dimensions there is no need to keep track of the left- and right- inverse data. Words become vectors, and pregroup reductions become bell-states, or bell-measurements, depending on whether one reads top-down or bottom-up.

This discovery clarified a value proposition: insights from quantum theory could be applied in the linguistic setting, and linguistics offered a novel use-case for quantum computers.

Briefly, G\"{a}rdenfors posits that spatial representations of concepts mediate raw sense data and symbolic representations -- e.g. red is a region in colourspace -- and moreover that concepts ought to be spatially convex -- e.g. mixing any two shades of red still gives red. This paper created a new point in the value proposition: that new mathematics would arise from investigating the linguistic-quantum bridge, e.g. generalised relations \begin  {color}{red}CITE \end  {color}\xspace  . Although labelled as if it is the first in a series, the paper never saw a sequel by the same title, blocked by an apparently simple but actually tricky theoretical problem. The problem is that while this convex-relational story worked for conceptual adjectives modifying a single noun such for "sweet yellow bananas", there was difficulty in extending the story to work for multiple objects interacting in the same space, as in "cup on table in room". It couldn't be worked out what structure a sentence-wire in \textbf  {ConvexRel} ought to have in order to accommodate (in principle) arbitrarily many objects and spatial relations between them.\\ \par DisCoCat then diverges from the story I want to tell.

Joshi stresses that adjoining \emph  {preserves} links, and that elementary trees may become \emph  {stretched} in the process of derivation, which are fundamentally topological constraints, akin to the "only (processive) connectivity" matters criterion identifying string diagrams up to isomorphism. Moreover, TAGs evidently have links of two natures: tree edges intended to be planar, and dashed dependency edges intended to freely cross over tree edges. It is easy, but a hack, to ask for planar processive isomorphisms for tree edges and extraplanar behaviour for dependency edges: these are evidently two different kinds of structure glued together, rather than facets of some whole. Weak $n$-categories offer a unified mathematical framework that natively accommodates the desired topological constraints while also granting expressive control over wire-types of differing behaviours. One method to recover TAGs true to the original conception is to stay in a planar 1-object-2-category setting while explicitly including wire-crossing cells for dependency links. The alternative method we opt for in Section \begin  {color}{red}ref \end  {color}\xspace  is to work in a pure "only connectivity matters" setting, recovering the linear ordering of words by generating cells along a chosen wire. I do not know of any conceptual justification for why planarity is so often an implicit constraint in approaches to formal syntax.
