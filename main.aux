Whereas a group is a monoid with inverses up to left- and right-multiplication, a pregroup weakens the requirement for inverses so that all elements have distinct left- and right- inverses, denoted $x^{-1}$ and $^{-1}x$ respectively. Eliminating or introducing inverses is a non-identity relation on elements of the pregroup, so we have axioms of the form e.g. $x \cdot ^{-1}x \ \rightarrow \ 1 \ \rightarrow \ ^{-1}x \cdot x$. In this formulation, denoting the multiplication with a dot, both $(n/s)\setminus n$ and $(n/s)\setminus n$ become $^{-1}n \cdot s \cdot n^{-1}$, which just wants a noun to the left and a noun to the right in whatever order to eliminate the flanking inverses to reveal the embedded sentence type. Now we can obtain the same proof of correctness as a series of algebraic reductions.}}{37}{figure.caption.9}\protected@file@percent }

The basic types $n$ and $s$ are assigned finite-dimensional vector spaces, concatenation of types the Kronecker product $\otimes $, and by the isomorphism of dual spaces in finite dimensions there is no need to keep track of the left- and right- inverse data. Words become vectors, and pregroup reductions become bell-states, or bell-measurements, depending on whether one reads top-down or bottom-up.

Although labelled as if it is the first in a series, the paper never saw a sequel by the same title, blocked by an apparently simple but actually tricky theoretical problem: while this convex-relational story worked for conceptual adjectives modifying a single noun (such as for "sweet yellow bananas"), there was difficulty in extending the story to work for multiple objects interacting in the same space, as in "cup on table in room". It couldn't be worked out what structure a sentence-wire in \textbf  {ConvexRel} ought to have in order to accommodate (in principle) arbitrarily many objects and spatial relations between them.  \par DisCoCat then diverges from the story I want to tell. In no particular order, QNLP was done on an actual quantum computer \citep  {lorenz_qnlp_2023}, some software packages were written \citep  {kartsaklis_lambeq_2023}, and some art happened \citep  {a_quantum_computer_ludovico_nodate}.}}{45}{figure.caption.20}\protected@file@percent }

The same thing happened with DisCoCirc, due to a combination of practical constraints and theoretical ambition. On the practical side, wide tensors were (and remain) prohibitively expensive to simulate classically and actual quantum computers did not (and still do not) have many qubits, hence in practice pregroup diagrams were reduced to thinner and deeper circuits, often with the help of an additional simplifying assumption that sentence wires were pairs of noun wires in the illustrated form on the left.

The diagrammatic motivation for the additional coherence equations is that -- if we view the lifts of opfibrations as sliding morphisms into functor boxes -- we do not want the order in which sliding occurs to affect the final result. In this way, lifts behave as graphical primitives in the same manner as interchange isotopies and symmetry twists. \leavevmode {\color  {blue}Postscript: Stefano Gogioso observes that this property may be simplified to asking that for all $f: \mathbf  {F}A \rightarrow B$, there exists a unique $\varphi _f: A \rightarrow \Phi _f$ such that for all objects $C$, $\mathbf  {F}(\varphi _f \otimes 1_C) = f \otimes 1_{\mathbf  {F}C}$, which is potentially easier to verify, and moreover related to "complete" variants of properties (c.f. complete positivity in categorical quantum mechanics) where a property is stable under tensors with the identity. After helpful discussions with Joe Moeller, in joint and ongoing work with Caterina Puca analysing functor boxes we show that these equations are equivalent to asking that the cartesian lift of tensors is equal to the tensor of cartesian lifts. This condition in conjunction with asking for the underlying functor to be strict monoidal and a opfibration then agrees with the "canon" definition of monoidal opfibrations given by Mike Shulman, for the discrete case.} \end  {defn}}}{87}{figure.caption.59}\protected@file@percent }

The mechanism that enables this in our setting is that the empty string is equal to copies of itself, which creates the necessary space for manoeuvering; translating into the $n$-categorical setting, expressions are equivalent up to introducing and contracting identities.}}{123}{figure.caption.85}\protected@file@percent }

Up to processive isotopies, which are continuous bijective transformations that don't let wires double back on themselves, we can identify two different braidings that are not continuously deformable to one another in the 3-dimensional space of the vignette. We distinguish the braidings visually by letting wires either go over or under one another.}}{123}{figure.caption.86}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.20}{\ignorespaces TAG signature and example derivation. Joshi stresses that adjoining \emph  {preserves} links, and that elementary trees may become \emph  {stretched} in the process of derivation, which are fundamentally topological constraints, akin to the "only (processive) connectivity matters" criterion identifying string diagrams up to isomorphism. Moreover, TAGs evidently have links of two natures: tree edges intended to be planar, and dashed dependency edges intended to freely cross over tree edges. It is easy, but a hack, to ask for planar processive isomorphisms for tree edges and extraplanar behaviour for dependency edges: these are evidently two different kinds of structure glued together, rather than facets of some whole. Weak $n$-categories offer a unified mathematical framework that natively accommodates the desired topological constraints while also granting expressive control over wire-types of differing behaviours. One method to recover TAGs true to the original conception is to stay in a planar 1-object-2-category setting while explicitly including wire-crossing cells for dependency links. The alternative method we opt for in Section \ref  {sec:gencirc} is to work in a pure "only connectivity matters" setting, recovering the linear ordering of words by generating cells along a chosen wire. I do not know of any conceptual justification for why planarity is so often an implicit constraint in approaches to formal syntax. My best guesses are either that the first port of call for rewrites between 1-dimensional strings of words is a 2-dimensional setting, or it is a limitation of 2-dimensional paper as a medium of thought along with some confusion of map for territory.}}{126}{figure.caption.89}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.21}{\ignorespaces With our interpretation of TAGS as weak $n$-categorical signatures, We can recover each step of the same example derivation automagically in \texttt  {homotopy.io}; just clicking on where we want rewrites allows the proof assistant to execute a typematching tree adjunction. In the process of interpretation, we introduce a link wire-type (in purple), and include directed link generation and elimination morphisms for the $T$ wire-type (in blue). A necessary step in the process of interpretation (which for us involves taking a Poincar\'{e} dual to interpret nodes as wires) is a typing assignment of the tree-branches connected to terminal nodes, which we have opted to read as sharing a $T$-type for minimality, though we could just as well have introduced a separate label-type wire.}}{127}{figure.caption.90}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.22}{\ignorespaces The intended takeaway is that even if you don't buy the necessity or formality of weak $n$-categories, there is always the fallback epistemic underpinning of a formal proof assistant for higher dimensional rewriting theories, which is rather simple to use if I have succeeded in communicating higher-dimensional intuitions in this section. \textbf  {N.B.} In practice when using \texttt  {homotopy.io} for the symmetric monoidal setting, it is simpler to suspend symmetric monoidal signatures to begin at 4-cells rather than 3-cells. The reason for this is that under- and over-braids still exist in the symmetric monoidal setting, and while sequentially composed braids are homotopically equivalent to the pair of identities, they are not uniquely so, thus these homotopies must be input manually. By beginning at 4-cells (or higher, due to the stabilisation hypothesis \citep  {nlab_authors_stabilization_nodate}), braid-eliminations are unique up to homotopy and can be performed more easily in the proof assistant.}}{127}{figure.caption.91}\protected@file@percent }
