\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {19}{\ignorespaces To eliminate this asymmetry, Lambek devised pregroup grammars. Whereas a group is a monoid with inverses up to left- and right-multiplication, a pregroup weakens the requirement for inverses so that all elements have distinct left- and right- inverses, denoted $x^{-1}$ and $^{-1}x$ respectively. Eliminating or introducing inverses is a non-identity relation on elements of the pregroup, so we have axioms of the form e.g. $x \cdot ^{-1}x \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow ^{1}x \cdot x$. In this formulation, denoting the multiplication with a dot, both $(n/s)\setminus n$ and $(n/s)\setminus n$ become $^{-1}n \cdot s \cdot n^{-1}$, which just wants a noun to the left and a noun to the right in whatever order to eliminate the flanking inverses to reveal the embedded sentence type. Now we can obtain the same proof of correctness as a series of algebraic reductions. \par \begin  {align*} & &n \cdot (^{-1}n \cdot s \cdot n^{-1}) \cdot n\\ &\rightarrow &(n \cdot ^{-1}n) \cdot s \cdot (n^{-1} \cdot n)\\ &\rightarrow & 1 \cdot s \cdot 1\\ &\rightarrow & s \end  {align*} }}{35}{subsection.0.7.1}\protected@file@percent }

The basic types $n$ and $s$ are assigned finite-dimensional vector spaces, concatenation of types the kronecker product $\otimes $, and by the isomorphism of dual spaces in finite dimensions there is no need to keep track of the left- and right- inverse data. Words become vectors, and pregroup reductions become bell-states, or bell-measurements, depending on whether one reads top-down or bottom-up.

Briefly, G\"{a}rdenfors posits \citep  {gardenfors_geometry_2014} that spatial representations of concepts mediate raw sense data and symbolic representations -- e.g. red is a region in colourspace -- and moreover that concepts ought to be spatially convex -- e.g. mixing any two shades of red still gives red. A new point in the value proposition arose: that new mathematics would arise from investigating the linguistic-quantum bridge, e.g. generalised relations \citep  {marsden_custom_2017}. Although labelled as if it is the first in a series, the paper never saw a sequel by the same title, blocked by an apparently simple but actually tricky theoretical problem: while this convex-relational story worked for conceptual adjectives modifying a single noun (such as for "sweet yellow bananas"), there was difficulty in extending the story to work for multiple objects interacting in the same space, as in "cup on table in room". It couldn't be worked out what structure a sentence-wire in \textbf  {ConvexRel} ought to have in order to accommodate (in principle) arbitrarily many objects and spatial relations between them.\\ \par DisCoCat then diverges from the story I want to tell.

Joshi stresses that adjoining \emph  {preserves} links, and that elementary trees may become \emph  {stretched} in the process of derivation, which are fundamentally topological constraints, akin to the "only (processive) connectivity" matters criterion identifying string diagrams up to isomorphism. Moreover, TAGs evidently have links of two natures: tree edges intended to be planar, and dashed dependency edges intended to freely cross over tree edges. It is easy, but a hack, to ask for planar processive isomorphisms for tree edges and extraplanar behaviour for dependency edges: these are evidently two different kinds of structure glued together, rather than facets of some whole. Weak $n$-categories offer a unified mathematical framework that natively accommodates the desired topological constraints while also granting expressive control over wire-types of differing behaviours. One method to recover TAGs true to the original conception is to stay in a planar 1-object-2-category setting while explicitly including wire-crossing cells for dependency links. The alternative method we opt for in Section \ref  {sec:gencirc} is to work in a pure "only connectivity matters" setting, recovering the linear ordering of words by generating cells along a chosen wire. I do not know of any conceptual justification for why planarity is so often an implicit constraint in approaches to formal syntax. My best guesses are either that the first port of call for rewrites between 1-dimensional strings of words is a 2-dimensional setting, or it is a limitation of 2-dimensional paper as a medium of thought along with some confusion of map for territory.}}{106}{theorem.2.1.8}\protected@file@percent }

The identity-on-objects functor part of the cofunctor maps our chosen interpretation into the following diagram in \textbf  {ContRel}. The configuration space of the \texttt  {TRADEABLES} spider is expanded via split idempotent so that all thin wires in the diagram are typed as the Euclidean plane.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.12}{\ignorespaces In a more detailed conceptual model of \texttt  {TIME is MONEY}, rather than just \texttt  {TRADE}, we might consider income, the spender's agency, and cost. In Euclidean 3-space, we might model income as a clock-gated mechanism that deposits time-tokens serially into Vincent's possession, along with his agency as a gated chute, and the time cost of writing a thesis as a dispenser that requires a certain number of tokens to release a thesis-token into Vincent's possession. In this sketch model, one obtains short films for \texttt  {He used to waste his mornings but now he spends them writing}, or \texttt  {He once spent an evening writing but made no progress}. One can then ascertain certain consequences truth-theoretically; for instance that there is at least one morning that was not spent on writing, or that there is at least one evening spent on writing but not inside the slot that would help a thesis-release mechanism trigger. In every case, cofunctoriality handles bookkeeping for role-interpretation choices and guarantees systematicity of the topological figure according to the signature at the apex model that models the organising concept.}}{248}{theorem.4.1.4}\protected@file@percent }
