\begin{defn}[Powerset monad on \textbf{Top}]
Overloading the powerset symbol $\mathcal{P}$, we define the functor $\mathcal{P}: \mathbf{Top} \rightarrow \mathbf{Top}$ to send:
\begin{description}
\item[objects:] $X^\tau \mapsto \mathcal{P}X^{\mathcal{P}\tau}$, where $\mathcal{P}X$ is the powerset of $X$, and we define the new topology \[\mathcal{P}\tau := \{ S \subseteq \tau : \bigcup S \in \tau \}\]
\item[morphisms:] $f: X^\tau \rightarrow Y^\sigma$ to $\mathcal{P}f: \mathcal{P}X^{\mathcal{P}\tau} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}Y^{\mathcal{P}\sigma}$, where $\mathcal{P}f$ is the direct image map.
\[\mathcal{P}f(J \subseteq X) := f(J) \subseteq Y\]
\end{description}
This endofunctor $\mathcal{P}$ on \textbf{Top} is a monad, with unit and multiplication inherited from the powerset monad on \textbf{Set}. We present these explicitly, and verify their continuity:
\begin{description}
\item[unit:] $X^\tau \overset{\eta_{X^{\tau}}}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{P}X^{\mathcal{P}\tau} := x \in X \mapsto \{x\} \in \mathcal{P}X$.
For continuity, if $S \subseteq \mathcal{P}X$ is open, by definition of $\mathcal{P}\tau$, $\bigcup S \subseteq X$ is open
\item[multiplication:] $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{P}X^{\mathcal{P}\mathcal{P}\tau} \overset{\mu_{X^{\tau}}}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{P}X^{\mathcal{P}\tau}: S \subseteq \mathcal{P}\tau \mapsto \bigcup S \in \mathcal{P}\tau$
\end{description}

\begin{defn}[Partial Functions]
A \textbf{continuous partial function} $X^\tau \rightarrow Y^\sigma$ is the intersection of a continuous function and a bowtie. 
\end{defn}

\marginnote{
\begin{intuition}\label{intuit:screen}
View the space as a screen display, with points as pixels. Then states are "shapes" of lit up pixels, and effects are "tests", which check for lit pixels in an open set. In a discrete topology, all shapes are distinguishable by testing. In an indiscrete topology, the only distinction is between "no shape" and "some shape".

\subsection{ Compact Hausdorff spaces are arachnid }

\marginnote{

\begin{rem}[Compactness]
An \textbf{open cover} of a space $X^\tau$ is a set of opens $\{U_i: i \in I\} \subset \tau$ such that:
\[ \bigcup\limits_{i \in I} U_i = X \]
A \textbf{subcover} of an open cover is a subset of the open cover that is still an open cover.
$X^\tau$ is \textbf{compact} when every open cover has a finite subcover.
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}[Hausdorff]
$X^\tau$ is \textbf{Hausdorff} when for any two distinct points $a,b \in X$ there are disjoint opens $U,V \in \tau$ such that $a \in U$ and $b \in V$. The mnemonic is that the points are "housed-off".
\end{rem}

}

\begin{defn}[Non-unital Spider]
A \textbf{non-unital spider} on $X^\tau$ is a tuple [[[placeholder]]] that satisfies the following relations:

\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Arachnidity]
Call $X^\tau$ \textbf{arachnid} if it admits a family of non-unital spiders such that for any finite family $\mathbb{K}:=\{K_i \subset X : i \in I, \ |I| \in \mathbb{N}\}$ of subsets of $X$, there exists a non-unital spider on $X^\tau$ such that:

[[placeholder]]

\end{defn}

\begin{theorem}[Compact Hausdorff is Arachnidity]
$X^\tau$ is compact and Hausdorff iff $X^\tau$ is arachnid.
\end{theorem}

We prove this by first relating arachnidity to some conditions that are phrased in the "distinguishing shapes" setting of Intuition \ref{intuit:screen}, and then bridge to compact Hausdorff.

\subsection{Arachnidity, Distinguishing, Encoding, Recognition}

\newthought{When is the topology of a space "good"?} There are several possible criteria for "goodness", such as the ability to distinguish different shapes, encode those shapes in the results of testing, and reconstruct those shapes from an encoding.

An \textbf{encoding} of $K \subset X$ with respect to a test battery $\mathbb{T}: \{U_i : i \in I, U_i \in \tau\}$ is a direct sum:

\marginnote{
    \begin{remark}
    A recogniser can take any finite curriculum and provide a finite test battery such that shapes can be distinguished via their finite encodings. Finiteness is a weak but necessary condition computability -- i.e. practical feasibility.

}
\begin{defn}[Recognition: computable distinguishing encodings]
$X^\tau$ is a \textbf{recogniser} if for any finite $\mathbb{K} := \{ K_i \subseteq X : i \in I, \ |I|\in \mathbb{N} \}$, there exists a finite test battery $\mathbb{U} := \{ U_j \in \tau: j \in J, \ |J|\in \mathbb{N} \} \subseteq \tau$ such that:
\[K_a \neq K_b \iff placeholder\]
\end{defn}

\marginnote{
    \begin{remark}
    Instead of providing a different test battery for each curriculum, it would be more convenient to extend the test battery whenever an unseen shape enters the curriculum; this is what a learner does.

\begin{defn}[Learning: extendable recognisers]
A recogniser is a \textbf{learner} when, for arbitrary finite curricula $\mathbb{K}' \supset \mathbb{K}$ and a finite test battery $\mathbb{U}$:

\section{Enrichment structure}



Denote by $(X \times Y)^{(\tau \multimap \sigma)}$ the topological space of topological relations of type $X^\tau \rightarrow Y^\sigma$ as given above. We show that this topology is finer than the product topology.

\begin{proposition}
For any $X^\tau$ and $Y^\sigma$, $\tau \times \sigma \subseteq \tau \multimap \sigma$
\begin{proof}
Let $\mathfrak{b}_\tau, \mathfrak{b}_\sigma$ be bases for $\tau$ and $\sigma$ respectively, then $\tau \times \sigma$ has basis $\mathfrak{b}_\tau \times \mathfrak{b}_\sigma$. An arbitrarily element $(t \in \tau, s \in \sigma)$ of this product basis can be viewed as a topological relation $t \times s \subseteq X \times Y$. Every open of $\tau \times \sigma$ is a union of such basis elements, and topological relations are closed under arbitrary union, so we have the (evidently injective) correspondence:
\[ \tau \times \sigma \ni \bigcup\limits_{i \in I}(t_i \times s_i) \mapsto \bigcup\limits_{i \in I}(t_i \times s_i) \in \tau \multimap \sigma \]
\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\marginnote{
\begin{example}[$\tau \multimap \sigma \nsubseteq \tau \times \sigma$]
Recalling Proposition \ref{prop:states}, let $\tau = \{\varnothing,\{\star\}\}$ on the singleton, and $\sigma$ be an arbitrary nondiscrete topology on base space Y. $(\{\star\} \times Y)^{(\tau \times \sigma)}$ is isomorphic to $Y^\sigma$, but $(\{\star\} \times Y)^{\tau \multimap \sigma)}$ is the isomorphic to the discrete topology $Y^\bullet$. For a more concrete example, consider the Sierpi\'{n}ski space $\mathcal{S}$ again, along with the topological relation $\{(0,0),(1,0),(1,1)\} \subset \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{S}$; due to the presence of $(0,0)$, this topological relation cannot be formed by a union of basis elements of the product topology, which are:
\begin{description}
\item[$\{1\} \times \{1\}$ =] $\{(1,1)\}$
\item[$\{1\} \times \{0,1\}$ =] $\{ (1,0),(1,1) \}$
\item[$\{0,1\} \times \{1\}$ =] $\{ (1,1),(0,1) \}$
\item[$\{0,1\} \times \{0,1\}$ =] $\{ (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (0,1) \}$
\end{description}

\end{example}
}

$\tau \multimap \sigma = \tau \times \sigma \iff $

Here are two ways to think about \textbf{TopRel} in relation to other categories. First, we can think of the analogy
\[\mathbf{TopRel}:\mathbf{Rel}::\mathbf{Top}:\mathbf{Set}\]
This analogy holds up to the free-forgetful adjunction between \textbf{Top} and \textbf{Set} embedding into a free-forgetful adjunction between \textbf{TopRel} and \textbf{Rel}.\marginnote{
    \begin{remark}[\textbf{TopRel} is not Kleisli in the obvious way]
    However, while \textbf{Rel} is the Kleisli category of \textbf{Set} with respect to the powerset monad, \textbf{TopRel} doesn't seem to be the Kleisli category of \textbf{Top} in an analogous way. The obvious notion of a powerset topology $\mathcal{P}\tau := \{S \subset \tau : \bigcup S \in \tau\}$ agrees with our na\"{i}ve definition of continuous relation, but the underlying unit and multiplication maps from the powerset monad on \textbf{Set} fail to be continuous with respect to this topology.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Although this thesis is about language, it is not really linguistics.
Linguistics, conventionally, is about understanding human language.
Formal linguistic theories rely on empirical observation of human language use.
Now there are not-human entities that use human language.
Now there are un-natural languages that humans use.
So I am interested in sketching a form of language that humans and computers can use\footnote{So this is not intended to be a total account of linguistics; there is no discussion of phonetics, pragmatics or anything else beyond text. Even among text, the intention here}.
This sketch is informed by, but not bound to, human language.\\

Although this thesis is mathematical, it is not really mathematics.
This thesis does not introduce significantly new mathematical constructions or relations.
So there are no new "know that"s.
This thesis does use relatively modern mathematics to approach an old problem.
The math is symmetric monoidal categories, the problem is depicting language.
So there is new "know how".\\

This thesis is computer science, a little.
The mathematics used is, to a degree, implementation agnostic.
This thesis is only concerned with the "in principle", rather than the "in practice".
There will be no code demonstration nor machine learning experiments, because
Computer Science is to Programming as Physics is to Engineering.
I will point out where experiments have been done.
Hypothetical procedures will be spelled out if needed.





\newthought{An idempotent on $Y^\sigma$ that splits through a discrete topology $X^\star$ does these things:}
\begin{description}
\item[The section:]{picks a subset of $s(x) \subseteq Y$ for each point $x \in X$. In order to be a split idempotent, $s(x)$ must be distinct for distinct points $x$.}
\item[The retract:]{(reading backwards) picks an open set $r(x) \in \sigma$ for each point $x \in X$. In order to be a split idempotent, $r(x)$ only overlaps $s(x)$ out of all other selected shapes: \[r(x) \cap s(x') = 1 \iff x = x'\]}
\end{description}
The combined effect is that the shapes $s(x)$ become copiable elements of the sticky spider, just as the points are the copiable elements of a regular spider.


\begin{defn}[\textbf{PLoc}]
A \emph{partial frame homomorphism} is a partial map between frames $\psi: A \rightarrow B$ such that, restricted to the domain of definition in $A$, $\psi$ is a frame homomorphism. The category \textbf{PLoc} is obtained in the same manner as \textbf{PLoc}, but using partial frame homomorphisms instead, which is well defined as a subcategory of \textbf{Pfn}, the category of sets and partial functions. \textbf{Loc} is thus a subcategory of \textbf{PLoc}.
